However, persistent cloud cover during the summer growing season in Florida often limits the application of optical sensors. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has the advantage over optical data by operating at wavelengths not impeded by cloud cover, rain or a lack of illumination. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of using Sentinel-1A C-band SAR data for classifying citrus in Florida. Twelve individual citrus classifications produced using single date optical or SAR data, as well as multi-date optical and SAR data fusion, are designed and tested. It is found that the classification accuracies of Sentinel-l C-band SAR data are slightly lower than those of multi-temporal cloud free optical data (approximately 2.5% difference). However, the relatively comparable classification accuracy results indicate that the Sentinel-1 SAR is a useful alternative imagery source particularly in regions with persistent cloud cover.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-7150-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8519223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519223","Sentinel-1;Synthetic Aperture Radar;Agricultural land cover classification;Citrus classification","Synthetic aperture radar;Optical imaging;Adaptive optics;Optical sensors;Agriculture;Remote sensing;Earth","crops;geophysical image processing;image classification;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sensor fusion;synthetic aperture radar","Sentinel-1A C-band synthetic aperture radar;Sentinel-1 SAR;multitemporal cloud free optical data;classification accuracies;multidate optical;single date optical;individual citrus classifications;classifying citrus;C-band SAR data;Synthetic Aperture Radar;optical sensors;summer growing season;persistent cloud cover;citrus crop change monitoring;optical based remote sensing;United States;Florida;citrus CROP classification","","1","","11","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Obviously, for crop classification, multi-temporal PolSAR data can provide more information than single-temporal PolSAR data, but the processing method of the matching image data is relatively backward. Aiming at the high-dimensional data composed of multi-temporal PolSAR, this paper proposes a method to integrate the stacked auto-encoder network and convolutional neural network, making full use of the dimension reduction advantages of the stacked auto-encoder network and the superior classification performance of the convolutional neural network. By constructing a fusion network, the multi-temporal PolSAR images can be processed once, the classification accuracy can be improved, and the processing steps can be simplified. The experimental results show that, compared with the traditional Stacked Auto-encoder and Convolutional Neural Network (SAE-CNN) classification method, the multitemporal PolSAR image classification method based on Fusion of Stacked Auto-encoder and Convolutional Neural Network (F-SAE-CNN) proposed in this paper has the highest classification accuracy, which effectively combines the advantages of the self-encoding network and the CNN network, and provides a new idea for PolSAR image classification work.","","979-8-3503-9871-7","10.1109/CISS57580.2022.9971318","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Ministry of Natural Resources; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9971318","Crop Classification;Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR);Multi-temporal;F-SAE-CNN","Dimensionality reduction;Neural networks;Crops;Data processing;Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar;Classification algorithms;Convolutional neural networks","convolutional neural nets;image classification;radar computing;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;synthetic aperture radar","CNN network;convolutional neural network classification method;crop classification;dimension reduction;F-SAE-CNN;fusion network;high-dimensional data;matching image data;multitemporal PolSAR data;multitemporal PolSAR image classification method;multitemporal PolSAR images;polarimetric SAR data;polarimetric synthetic aperture radar imagery;PolSAR image classification;self-encoding network;single-temporal PolSAR data;stacked auto-encoder network;superior classification performance;traditional stacked auto-encoder","","","","12","IEEE","12 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Identifying the timing of these phases is crucial for river discharge, avalanches and snow contaminants monitoring. An alternative to the sporadic and punctual snow water equivalent (SWE) and liquid water content (LWC) measurements is represented by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). We analyze the correlation between the multi-temporal C-band SAR backscattering and the snow melting timing. The backscattering was compared with in situ observations and snow modelling simulations for two test sites in the Alpine region. SAR sensitivity to LWC variation and snow properties enables the identification of the snow melting phases. A strong decrease of the backscattering in correspondence of an increase of LWC, e.g. during the moistening phase, is observed. Furthermore, an increase of backscattering happens in correspondence of SWE decrease, e.g. during the run-off phase. We discuss the possible mechanisms which affect SAR backscattering, related both to LWC and snow structure variations. The presented investigation could have relevant application for monitoring and predicting the snowmelt progress over large regions.","","978-88-907018-8-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8740300","Snow melting;multi-temporal;Synthetic Aperture Radar;Copernicus Sentinel-1","Snow;Backscatter;Synthetic aperture radar;Liquids;Temperature measurement;Atmospheric modeling;Monitoring","hydrological techniques;remote sensing by radar;rivers;snow;synthetic aperture radar","multitemporal Sentinel-1 backscattering;Alpine region;complex process;run-off phase;snow contaminants monitoring;liquid water content measurements;snow melting timing;snow modelling simulations;SAR sensitivity;LWC variation;snow melting phases;moistening phase;ripening phase;snow water equivalent;synthetic aperture radar;multitemporal C-band SAR backscattering;river discharge","","","","9","","20 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because Japan has so many dikes to survey, an efficient surveying approach is needed. This paper presents the results and accuracy of dike elevation estimation using multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. First, the displacement along the radar line-of-sight direction was calculated by applying persistent-scatterer interferometry to SAR images observed on ascending and descending orbits. The least-squares method was then applied to those results, and the east-west and vertical displacement velocities were estimated by assuming that no north-south displacement occurred. Finally, the displacement velocity was multiplied by a chosen time period, and the elevation at the end of that time period was obtained by adding the known initial elevation. The experimental results show that the root-mean-square error of the elevation of the dike crown was 5.3 cm whereas that of the dike slope exceeded 25 cm. It is concluded that the presented approach is effective for monitoring the dike crown, and the accuracy of the elevation of the dike slope is expected to improve.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8898110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8898110","Synthetic aperture radar (SAR);dike displacement monitoring;multi-temporal SAR image analysis;PSInSAR","Levee;Laser radar;Synthetic aperture radar;Two dimensional displays;Radar polarimetry;Rivers;Orbits","radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","dike slope;dike crown;multitemporal SAR images;efficient dike management;Japan;dikes;efficient surveying approach;dike elevation estimation;multitemporal synthetic aperture radar images;radar line-of-sight direction;persistent-scatterer interferometry;ascending descending orbits;least-squares method;east-west displacement velocities;vertical displacement velocities;displacement velocity;chosen time period;known initial elevation;root-mean-square error;size 200.0 m;size 5.3 cm;size 25.0 cm","","","","7","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here we present the first comprehensive multi-sensor cumulative deformation map for the dam generated from space-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements from the Italian constellation COSMO-SkyMed and the European Sentinel-1a satellite. We compared 2014-2016 data to an historic dataset spanning 2004-2010 acquired with the Envisat ASAR sensor. We found that deformation was rapid during 2004-2010, slowed down in 2012-2014, and restarted in August 2014 when grouting operations stopped due to the temporary capture of the dam by the self proclaimed Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

Here we propose a new change detection method using an adaptive temporal subset multi-temporal InSAR method. Single pixel change detection is developed using amplitude time series in order to identify the step-times: changes in the temporal domain. Then the parameters, e.g. deformation velocity are estimated and the coherent intervals are determined using interferometric phase time series. With the identified TCS, we distinguish different types of changes based on their coherent intervals. The main advantages of our method are reliable unsupervised change detection and detecting different types of changes without additional information.

Although an approximately model can be made by assuming a linear relationship between topography and delayed phase in the interferogram, the estimation is weakened by the spatial variability of troposphere and the interference from other confounding signals (e.g., deformation, topographic error and orbit error, etc.). In this contribution, a jointly tropospheric correction scheme is proposed to simultaneously estimate stratified tropospheric delays with deformation and topographic errors. Spatial variability of tropospheric properties is addressed through a localized estimation which is derived by quadtree segmentation according to height gradient.

Instead of using the maximum and minimum backscatter of SAR data, as most studies in the literature, this study established a rice growth model based on complete time series data in the rice growth period. From the developed model, a feature related to rice growth time, that is, the time interval (TI) between vegetative growth and maturity stages was introduced. The proposed feature was first compared with the feature of backscatter difference (BD) between the maximum and minimum value of SAR data. The experimental results show that the proposed feature can achieve better rice detection accuracy. Then, a decision method based on the combination of TI and BD features was proposed for rice planting mapping. In the study, Yunlin and Changhua counties in central Taiwan were used as experimental areas. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve more than 90% overall accuracy in rice detection for VH polarization.

To this end an automatic and unsupervised coastline detection method is proposed. First, we apply a temporal averaging filter that allows encapsulating the temporal variations in coastal areas, e.g. due to tides or vegetation, and at the same time it allows reducing the speckle, without decreasing the spatial resolution of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Then, based on the distinctive backscattering values of the sea and land classes we employ an iterative hierarchical tiling method in order to accurately characterize the two classes by a bimodal distribution.

In the present study, three monitoring techniques including (i) an automated tracking total station (ATTS), (ii) multi-temporal terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and (iii) space-borne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) are applied to monitor the spatio-temporal displacement patterns of the Vögelsberg landslide (Tyrol, Austria) between 2016/05 and 2020/06. The landslide shows spatially and temporally varying displacement rates with up to 12 cm/a and a mean annual displacement of 4 cm/a. The results show that only the ATTS provides sufficient temporal resolution and spatial accuracy for assessing the temporal behaviour of the landslide's movement. However, ATTS measurements are only available at the installed 53 retro-reflecting prisms. Multi-temporal TLS can provide additional insight into the spatial displacement pattern at various man-made and natural objects such as walls, fences, poles and tree stems. But the respective accuracy and data acquisition intervals do not allow to draw conclusions about the temporal dynamics of the landslide's movement. Results of the InSAR technique based on Sentinel-1 imagery show good agreement with ATTS measurements, but cannot provide real-time information on the landslide's acceleration and deceleration phases. However, in combination, the measurement techniques provide vital information in both the spatial and temporal domain.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9553324","Deep-seated landslide;remote sensing;displacement monitoring;spatio-temporal analyses;OPERANDUM","Laser radar;Spaceborne radar;Measurement by laser beam;Terrain factors;Real-time systems;Sensors;Task analysis","data acquisition;geomorphology;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;hazards;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;terrain mapping","integrated monitoring;slowly moving landslide;total station measurements;multitemporal terrestrial laser scanning;continuous landslide monitoring;natural hazards;suitable mitigation measures;nature-based solutions;monitoring techniques;spatio-temporal displacement patterns;Vögelsberg landslide;displacement rates;mean annual displacement;sufficient temporal resolution;temporal behaviour;ATTS measurements;multitemporal TLS;spatial displacement pattern;natural objects;temporal dynamics;measurement techniques;spatial domain;temporal domain","","","","11","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For such reason, a considerable interest towards innovative approaches useful to provide information on their evolution and on the interaction with existing buildings has grown among the scientific community and land management institutions. To this purpose, the combined use of C-band satellites and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar sensors, has been successfully applied in several analyses aimed at the detection of spatial and temporal effects, in term of building's damage induced by landslides. This work provides a general approach useful to investigate, at different levels of detail, the cause-effect relationship. The proposed methodology has been applied to the urban settlement of Moio della Civitella (Salerno province, Italy), whose whole territory is affected by several slow-moving landslides. C and X-band SAR data (acquired between 2002 and 2014), integrated with field survey of structural damage, enhanced an accurate examination of landslide effects on the urban texture of Moio della Civitella. The results allowed to generate empirical fragility curves for buildings on the study area. These curves can be used as a tool to forecast the future likelihood of the damage occurrence. Finally, the behavior of a masonry building aggregate has been assessed analyzing Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) time-series pre- and post-repair intervention, thus providing information also about the efficacy of restoration works.","","978-1-5386-3906-1","10.1109/RTSI.2017.8065907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8065907","slow-moving landslides;buildings vulnerability;damage;fragility curves;Differential SAR Interferometry","Terrain factors;Synthetic aperture radar;Concrete;Urban areas;Interferometry;Satellites","building materials;buildings (structures);cause-effect analysis;geology;geomorphology;geophysical image processing;radar imaging;radar interferometry;structural engineering;synthetic aperture radar","multitemporal assessment;building damage;interferometric data;geological settings;structural damage;C-band satellites;X-band synthetic aperture radar sensors;urban settlement;Moio della Civitella;Italy;C SAR data;X-band SAR data;landslide effects;building fragility curves;masonry building aggregate;differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry;DInSAR;restoration works","","1","","15","IEEE","12 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations enable us to provide dramatic changes over a very wide swath of the glacier. Although differential radar interferometry (DInSAR) can estimate very accurate glacier movement, it is often suffered from a loss of coherence due to significant temporal and volume decorrelation. Hence, we used intensity offset tracking, which is capable to apply even if the displacement is large, using estimation of the displacement between the two adjacent areas determined by the cross-correlation of the amplitude between two SAR images. In this study, ice velocity of Narssap sermia was observed by using TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X X-band SAR images. We acquired 39 images which were collected in the stripmap mode at ascending direction, VV polarization, and incidence angle of 21.4 degree.

The most severe subsidence, up to 35 mm/year, was found in the southern part of Bolvadin which is characterized by the presence of soft alluvial deposits. Both in long and short term, there was a strong correlation between the subsidence and the groundwater level.

To overcome this problem, we propose a new method to detect stable features by intersecting Coherent Scatters (CS) and SAR-FAST corners. Thus the stable features are not only corners but also located at the time-invariant area. Then, the stable features are described by SIFT descriptors and the coarse registration is achieved by matching these stable points.

Regional snowcover area (SCA) is the basic parameters of hydrological model. In recent years, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been widely used in wet snow detection and SCA estimation during the spring melting period for its effectiveness. The absorption of electromagnetic waves by wet snow significantly reduces the SAR backscatter signal, which makes it possible to distinguish between wet snow and dry snow (or no snow). However, in forest areas, the sensitivity of traditional algorithms to detect snow changes is decreased due to the significant change of forest canopy transmittance with time and weather conditions. Based on the measured data of the forest area in northeastern China and the multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data, the influence of forest canopy on the C-band backscattering coefficient of SCA is analyzed, and an adaptive SCA estimation algorithm based on the forest backscatter model is introduced in this paper. The backscattering coefficient attenuation caused by the forest canopy can be predicted by the algorithm and the SCA estimation for the corresponding region will be corrected. The results show that the snow cover characteristic is accurately estimated and the SCA of forests in northeastern China is significantly smaller than that of the open area, while the SCA of coniferous forest areas is generally smaller than broadleaf forests areas in the early stage of snowmelt period.","","978-1-7281-5304-9","10.1109/PIERS-Fall48861.2019.9021756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9021756","","Forestry;Snow;Backscatter;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar imaging;Spaceborne radar","atmospheric electromagnetic wave propagation;forestry;hydrology;meteorology;snow;synthetic aperture radar","multitemporal Sentinel-1 SAR data;spring melting period;hydrological forecasting;meteorological forecasting;regional snowcover area;hydrological model;Synthetic Aperture Radar;wet snow detection;SAR backscatter signal;dry snow;snow changes;forest canopy transmittance;northeastern China;C-band backscattering coefficient;adaptive SCA estimation algorithm;forest backscatter model;backscattering coefficient attenuation;snow cover characteristic;open area;coniferous forest areas;broadleaf forests areas;snow covered area estimation;electromagnetic waves;weather condition;time condition","","","","11","IEEE","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the achievable estimates are not disturbed by phase unwrapping (PhU) errors. Noteworthy, the estimation of the ground displacement rate may reveal (in most cases) particularly suitable for retrieving geophysical information on the sources responsible for the observed deformations. Furthermore, the estimates of the DEM errors and the ground displacement rate can be used within advanced DInSAR processing chains for the retrieval of surface deformation time-series, with the aim to facilitate phase unwrapping operations and discriminate the desired signals (due to deformation) from residual phase artifacts.

The method is based on the computation of a “super-image”, with a large number of looks, by temporal averaging. Then, ratio images are formed by dividing each image of the multi-temporal stack by the “super-image”. In the absence of changes of the radiometry, the temporal fluctuations of the intensity at a given spatial location are due to the speckle phenomenon. In areas affected by temporal changes, fluctuations cannot be ascribed to speckle only but also to radiometric changes. The overall effect of the division by the “super-image” is the spatial stationarity improvement: ratio images are much more homogeneous than the original images. Therefore, filtering these ratio images with a speckle-reduction method is more effective, in terms of speckle suppression, than filtering the original multitemporal stack. After denoising of the ratio image, the despeckled multi-temporal stack is obtained by multiplication with the “super-image”.

Nevertheless, huge multi-temporal stacks are now often available and could be efficiently exploited to further improve image quality. This paper explores two fast strategies employing a single-image despeckling algorithm, namely SAR2SAR [1], in a multi-temporal framework. The first one is based on Quegan filter [2] and replaces the local reflectivity pre-estimation by SAR2SAR. The second one uses SAR2SAR to suppress speckle from a ratio image encoding the multi-temporal information under the form of a “super-image”, i.e. the temporal arithmetic mean of a time series.

Most presented change detection methods are conducted using couples of SAR amplitude images. However, a prior date of surface change is required to select a feasible image pair. We propose an automatic spatio-temporal change detection method by identifying the temporary coherent scatterers. Based on amplitude time series, x2-test and iterative single pixel change detection are proposed to identify all step-times: the moments of the surface change. Then the parameters, e.g., deformation velocity and relative height, are estimated and corresponding coherent periods are identified by using interferometric phase time series. With identified temporary coherent scatterers, different types of temporal surface changes can be classified using the location of the coherent periods and spatial significant changes are identified combining point density and F values. The main advantage of our method is automatically detecting spatio-temporal surface changes without prior information. Experimental results by the proposed method show that both appearing and disappearing buildings with their step-times are successfully identified and results by ascending and descending SAR images show a good agreement.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2021.000110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679700","change detection;temporary coherent scatterer;multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR);amplitude analysis","Time series analysis;Synthetic aperture radar;Urban areas;Optical interferometry;Lead;Faces;Calibration","geophysical techniques;radar interferometry;synthetic aperture radar","ascending descending SAR images;detecting spatio-temporal;identified temporary coherent scatterers;surface change;urban areas;short revisit time;disaster assessment;urbanization monitoring;detection methods;SAR amplitude images;feasible image pair;automatic spatio-temporal change detection method;amplitude time series;iterative single pixel change detection;step-times;interferometric phase time series;spatial significant changes;spatio-temporal surface changes;coherent periods","","2","","","","12 Jan 2022","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

InSAR technique is used to estimate the topographic reconstruction of the earth surface. The main problem of the range-Doppler focusing technique is the nature of the two-dimensional SAR result, affected by the layover indetermination. In order to resolve this problem, a minimum of two sensor acquisitions, separated by a baseline and extended in the cross-slant-range, are needed. However, given its multi-temporal nature, these techniques are vulnerable to atmosphere and Earth environment parameters variation in addition to physical platform instabilities. Furthermore, either two radars are needed or an interferometric cycle is required (that spans from days to weeks), which makes real time DEM estimation impossible. In this work, the authors propose a novel experimental alternative to the InSAR method that uses single-pass acquisitions, using a data driven approach implemented by Deep Neural Networks. We propose a fully Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Encoder-Decoder architecture, training it on radar images in order to estimate DEMs from single pass image acquisitions. Our results on a set of Sentinel images show that this method is able to learn to some extent the statistical properties of the DEM. The results of this exploratory analysis are encouraging and open the way to the solution of single-pass DEM estimation problem with data driven approaches.","","978-3-8007-4636-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8438199","","","","","","","","","","16 Aug 2018","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Multi-temporal Interferometric SAR (MT-InSAR) is able to monitor long-term and periodic deformation with high precision by time-series analysis. However, when a new image comes, it is time-consuming to reprocess the whole dataset using the traditional algorithm. Here we propose a recursive approach to deal with InSAR time series by subsequently analyzing the amplitude and the interferometric phase. Sequential change detection is developed to identify surface changes jointly with amplitude observation and initial dataset. Based on the predicted phase residual, scatterers with a phase anomaly are identified by a generalized ratio test while the parameters of other stable scatterers are updated using a static Kalman filter. The main advantage of this method is the real-time data process. Experimental results by the proposed method show that the estimated parameters by the recursive approach agree well with that by the standard approach, and InSAR technique can be used for the real-time evaluation of the deformation risk.","2474-2333","978-1-7281-2912-9","10.1109/APSAR46974.2019.9048417","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9048417","MT-InSAR;recursive process;Kalman filter;deformation monitoring","","deformation;geophysical image processing;Kalman filters;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;time series","InSAR technique;real-time evaluation;deformation risk;InSAR data;recursive amplitude;phase process;synthetic aperture radar systems;real-time deformation monitoring;multitemporal Interferometric SAR;MT-InSAR;periodic deformation;time-series analysis;recursive approach;InSAR time series;interferometric phase;sequential change detection;surface changes;amplitude observation;phase residual;real-time data process","","","","18","IEEE","30 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data present several favourable characteristics for flood mapping, such as their relative insensitivity to the meteorological conditions during acquisitions, thanks to the use of microwaves as sensing radiation, as well as the possibility of acquiring imagery independently of solar illumination, thanks to the active nature of the radar sensors. The Italian COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) SAR constellation is particularly useful in this respect, because it allows image sequences of flooding events to be built up with short revisit times. The acquisition of several images before, during and after the event often allow a reconstruction of the flooding dynamics. Moreover, they help in interpreting the backscatter signatures of different land cover types, reducing uncertainties about the actual presence of water, which can be seriously misleading, especially over agricultural areas [1, 2]. Finally, when acquisitions are made from the same geometry, with short repeat intervals, SAR interferometry (InSAR) observables, such as the coherence or the differential InSAR phase can be exploited as additional information layers. The favorable characteristics of these next-generation sensors have been exploited by a number of researchers worldwide [3, 4, 5] to improve performances of flood mapping approaches. Recently, our group [6, 2] has used high-resolution CSK radar images for flood mapping exploiting both the intensity and the interferometric coherence, with promising results. Nevertheless, additional information can be used to improve flood detection. In case of flooding, distance from the river, terrain elevation, hydrologic information or some combination of these data can add useful information that leads to a better performance in flood detection.","2153-7003","978-1-4799-7929-5","10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7326034","","Synthetic aperture radar;Rivers;Coherence;Bayes methods;Backscatter;Floods;Earth","belief networks;floods;geophysical image processing;hydrological techniques;land cover;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;vegetation mapping","Bayesian network;SAR intensity fusion;data fusion;InSAR coherence imagery;InSAR ancillary data;flooded area;land cover type;hydraulic model;topographic model;satellite mapping;agricultural areas;backscatter flood signature;vegetation area;automatic classifier;coherence flood signature;Bradano river","","1","","14","IEEE","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At this test site we use data from three different SAR sensors: ALOS PALSAR, Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X. The forest disturbance maps are validated by visual interpretation and compared to the Landsat based Humid Tropical Forest Disturbance Alerts available from Global Forest Watch. Change mapping accuracies for plots larger than 0.5 ha are very high: 76% for ALOS PALSAR, 96% for TerraSAR-X and 98% for Sentinel-1. For Sentinel-1, producer accuracies were derived for different forest disturbance types. The overall accuracy is 81.8%, with highest values for deforestation in oil palm plantations and burnt areas. The results are similar to the accuracy of the Humid Tropical Forest Disturbance Alert layer, which detects 85.6% of all reference areas. We also show that fusion of the disturbance maps on a result level is possible.

This basin extends over 746 km2, at an altitude of 2780 m, with a very rough terrain and frequent torrential water flow. Due to the continuous extension of greenhouses in the east and west parts of Almería, the water demand for agriculture and urban consumption increases day by day. As a consequence, aquifers are being overexploited, causing the current system to not be sustainable for a long time, that is, the storage capacity of the underground media and their possible contributions to an efficient management of resources have not been adequately taken into account. The Benínar dam has always had problems with water leaks. The dam was built even knowing that the land was not the most suitable, due to the frequent earth movements that took place in the town of Benínar, which was submerged beneath the waters of the reservoir.

Our study area, Kansai International Airport, Osaka, Japan, consists of two landfilled islands, and the subsidence velocity of an island is much larger than that of the other one. In the preliminary examination, we observed that DInSAR analysis using multi-temporal TerraSAR-X (TSX), X-band SAR images, is subject to unwrapping errors in the second island. On the other hand, the analysis using multi-temporal Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) / Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Rader-2 (PALSAR2) images was found to include errors in estimating local subsidence velocity. The proposed method calibrates the mean subsidence velocity derived from TSX images by using the mean subsidence velocity derived from PALSAR-2 for avoiding the unwrapping errors. The validation results indicate the proposed method generates better accuracy of subsidence velocity than those derived from TSX or PALSAR2 images.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-4951-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8127109","SAR;DInSAR;PSInSAR;land subsidence velociy;data fusion","Synthetic aperture radar;Interferometry;Estimation;Mathematical model;L-band;Frequency estimation;Calibration","calibration;geomorphology;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;terrain mapping","local subsidence velocity;mean subsidence velocity;TSX images;unwrapping errors;land subsidence monitoring;land subsidence estimation;differential interferometric SAR technique;multitemporal TerraSAR-X images;frequency SAR images;frequency synthetic aperture radar images;PALSAR-2 images;Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Rader-2 images;multitemporal Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 images;Osaka;Japan;X-band SAR images;DInSAR analysis;landfilled islands;Kansai International Airport","","","","4","IEEE","4 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, multi-temporal segmentation is carried out to segment two temporal SAR images simultaneously. It considers the homogeneity in two temporal images, and could generate homogeneous objects in spectral, spatial and temporal. In addition, through setting different segmentation parameters, the multi-temporal images can be segmented in a set of scales. This process exploits the advantages of OBIA that could effectively reduce spurious changes, and considers the scale of change detection task. Secondly, a multiplicative noise model called Nakagami-Rayleigh distribution is employed to describe SAR data, and then applied to Bayesian formulation. Thus, a new statistical distance that is insensitive to speckles is derived to measure the distances between pairs of parcels. Then, cluster ensemble algorithm is utilized to improve accuracy of individual result in each scale to obtain the final change detection map. Finally, multi-temporal Radarsat-2 images are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with other four methods.","","978-1-5386-6396-7","10.1109/SIPROCESS.2018.8600504","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8600504","synthetic aperture radar (SAR);change detection;object-based image analysis;multi-scale analysis","Image segmentation;Synthetic aperture radar;Transforms;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Change detection algorithms;Shape","geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;image segmentation;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar","SAR data;final change detection map;multitemporal Radarsat-2 images;object-based method;novel statistical distance;SAR image change detection;multitemporal segmentation;homogeneous objects;multitemporal images;change detection task;temporal SAR images;segmentation parameters;OBIA;multiplicative noise model;Nakagami-Rayleigh distribution;Bayesian formulation;cluster ensemble algorithm","","","","15","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most MT-InSAR methods select scatterers with high coherence throughout the entire time series. However, as time series lengthen, inevitable changes in surface scattering lead to decorrelation, which systematically decreases the number of coherent scatterers. Here, we propose a novel method to detect and process temporary coherent scatterers (TCS) by subsequently analyzing the amplitude and the interferometric phase. Two hypothesis tests are developed for amplitude analysis in order to identify the moments of appearing and/or disappearing coherent scatterers. Based on the amplitude analysis, the parameters of interest are then estimated using the interferometric phase. An optimized adaptive temporal subset approach is proposed to improve the precision of the estimated parameters. If the scatterers are not evenly distributed over the area, a secondary (support) network is designed to improve the spatial point distribution. The main advantage of this method is the reliable extraction of a subset of time series without using any contextual information. Experimental results show that the TCSs significantly increase the number of observations for displacement monitoring and improve the change detection capability in urban construction areas.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2915658","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201706260149); State Key Development Program for Basic Research of China(grant numbers:2013CB733304); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41674003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8756305","Change detection;multi-temporal InSAR;Rayleigh distribution;temporary coherent scatterer","Time series analysis;Coherence;Decorrelation;Probability density function;Signal to noise ratio;Synthetic aperture radar","geomorphology;geophysical image processing;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;time series","incorporating temporary coherent scatterers;multitemporal InSAR;adaptive temporal subsets;multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar;MT-InSAR methods select scatterers;high coherence;entire time series;surface scattering lead;interferometric phase;amplitude analysis;disappearing coherent scatterers;optimized adaptive temporal subset approach","","15","","44","OAPA","8 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The change area in the initial differential image has local consistency and global prominence. By detecting the significant area to locate similar change areas, the coherent speckle noise outside the area can be eliminated. The use of hierarchical FCM clustering to automatically generate training samples can improve the reliability of training samples. In addition, in order to increase the distinction between the changed area and the non-changed area, a sparse automatic encoder is used to extract the changed features and generate a change detection map. Experiments using 4 sets of SAR images show that the algorithm can effectively reduce the effect of speckle noise on detection accuracy, the extraction of changing areas is more complete and meticulous, and the false detection rate is greatly reduced. Since the images in different time phases will be disturbed by weather, clouds, sea water, etc., the target segmentation algorithm can be used to extract the target of interest and highlight the changing area. Principal component analysis and k-means clustering method are used to reduce the influence of isolated pixels, and change information is extracted to obtain different images. The experiment uses four sets of image data of islands and reefs. The experiment proves that the algorithm can well eliminate external interference, improve the accuracy of change detection, and have a good detection effect on the area of islands and reefs. The adaptive parameter estimation plays a good role in the detection of changing areas, and the visual effect is better, which can improve the accuracy of the detection results.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2993910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9091151","Adaptive parameters;multi-temporal;remote sensing images;change detection model;superficial superposition","Remote sensing;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Change detection algorithms;Sparse matrices;Synthetic aperture radar;Detection algorithms","geophysical image processing;image segmentation;object detection;parameter estimation;pattern clustering;principal component analysis;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;speckle;synthetic aperture radar","initial differential image;change area;synthetic aperture radar remote sensing images;multitemporal image change detection algorithm;multitemporal remote sensing images;adaptive parameter estimation;change information;changing area;change detection map;changed features;nonchanged area;changed area;coherent speckle noise","","8","","50","CCBY","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although existing studies have extended from bi-temporal data pair to multi-temporal datasets to derive more plentiful information, there are still two problems to be solved in practical applications. First, change indicators constructed from incoherent feature only cannot characterize the change objects accurately. Second, the results of pixel-level methods are usually presented in the form of the noisy binary map, making the spatial change not intuitive and the temporal change of a single pixel meaningless. In this study, we propose an unsupervised man-made objects change detection framework using both coherent and incoherent features derived from multi-temporal SAR images. The coefficients of variation in time-series incoherent features and the man-made object index (MOI) defined with coherent features are first combined to identify the initial change pixels. Afterwards, an improved spatiotemporal clustering algorithm is developed based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and dynamic time warping (DTW), which can transform the initial results into noiseless object-level patches, and take the cluster center as a representative of the man-made object to determine the change pattern of each patch. An experiment with a stack of 10 TerraSAR-X images in Stripmap mode demonstrated that this method is effective in urban scenes and has the potential applicability to wide area change detection.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2022.000087","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41774006); Shanghai Science and Technology Development Foundation(grant numbers:20dz1201200); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9883009","change detection;multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data;coherent and incoherent features;clustering","Visualization;Change detection algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Urban areas;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Radar polarimetry","geophysical image processing;pattern clustering;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","extraordinary visual appearance;synthetic aperture radar images;difficult research topic;bi-temporal data pair;multitemporal datasets;change indicators;incoherent feature;pixel-level methods;spatial change;temporal change;single pixel meaningless;unsupervised man-made objects change detection framework;coherent features;multitemporal SAR images;time-series incoherent features;man-made object index;initial change pixels;noiseless object-level patches;change pattern;10 TerraSAR-X images;wide area change detection;unsupervised change detection;complex imaging mechanism","","","","30","","9 Sep 2022","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

They are generally stated as an energy minimization problem where specific penalty terms are applied to each component of the sought decomposition.

The fundamental idea is to exploit the phase inconsistencies of triples of (already) unwrapped sequence of interferograms, prior to the application of any inversion for the generation of surface displacement time-series, to independently identify, for every SAR pixels, the 2π-multiple integers corrections to be applied to the unwrapped phases for adjusting the time-inconsistent phase unwrapping errors.

To solve this problem, we propose a method of change detection based on a modified bottom-up visual attention model (VAM). In this method, multi-scale spatial features of an image are achieved by using the Gaussian pyramid analysis and combined into one visual saliency map by processing the center-surrounding difference maps. Then, the morphology theory and spatial characteristics of vehicles are exploited to detect salient locations in the saliency map. In the end, the salient locations between two saliency maps of the image pair are compared one by one and change detection of targets is acquired. Simulation results show that not only the probability of detection of foliage-concealed vehicle targets is raised, but the computational speed is able to be improved as well.","","978-1-5090-4828-1","10.1109/RADAR.2016.8059271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8059271","Ultra wide bandwidth;synthetic aperture radar;foliage-concealed targets;change detection;visual attention model","Clutter;Visualization;Synthetic aperture radar;Vegetation;Data visualization;Simulation;Feature extraction","Gaussian processes;geophysical image processing;image resolution;object detection;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar;ultra wideband radar","Gaussian pyramid analysis;visual saliency map;center-surrounding difference maps;foliage-concealed vehicle targets;visual attention;multitemporal UWB SAR image pair;multiscale spatial features;salient location detection;visual attention model;VAM;change detection","","","","10","IEEE","5 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We apply the Wishart distribution-based distance and modify the combination form for the SLIC distance measure such that the SLIC method can be adapted to the statistical characteristics of PolSAR imagery. Compared with existing PolSAR image superpixel methods, the proposed method has better time cost efficiency while maintaining the performance on segmentation results.

Among various technologies, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been successfully applied in urban settlement mapping in the past two decades. Although much effort with varying degrees of success has been made in previous studies, the research work is still ongoing, and three challenges should be highlighted. First, the effect of de-speckling is usually underestimated, to the extent that the improvement of the SAR image quality is totally ignored in some studies. Second, a method that combines full Interferometric SAR (InSAR) information is as yet missing. Third, training samples are generally required to process SAR images to extract urban settlements, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, or even impractical when classifying satellite data at the regional/global scale. To address these issues, this paper presents an automatic method for urban settlement mapping trained by multi-temporal InSAR using social media. To improve the detection performance and reduce false alarm ratio, intensity and coherence are first accurately estimated without loss of image resolution by homogeneous pixel selection and robust estimators. The homogeneous pixels will be also applied to measure urban characteristics from the geometrical prospective. After that, training samples are automatically generated from social media based on the fact that cities and urban areas are nowadays full of individual geo-referenced data such as social network data Finally, these multiple information sources will be fused to extract urban areas based on an improved one class classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in extracting urban areas with good accuracy. This study provides a new de-speckling means to process multi-temporal InSAR and sheds new light on the applications of social media in the field of remote sensing.","1559-9450","978-4-8855-2316-8","10.23919/PIERS.2018.8597712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8597712","","Social network services;Training;Feature extraction;Coherence;Synthetic aperture radar;Urban areas;Data mining","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image resolution;land use;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;social networking (online);synthetic aperture radar","urbanization process;Synthetic Aperture Radar;SAR image quality;Interferometric SAR information;SAR images;multitemporal InSAR;social media;urban characteristics;urban areas;social network data;automatic urban settlement mapping;satellite data;despeckling;remote sensing;image resolution","","","","9","","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lacking prior information of the cloudy areas, these methods are limited in reconstructing accuracy, especially when clouds lie on the boundaries of two types of landscapes.

A polarimetric-feature-driven deep CNN classification scheme is established with both classical roll-invariant polarimetric features and hidden polarimetric features in the rotation domain to drive the proposed deep CNN model. Comparison studies validate the efficiency and superiority of the proposal. For the benchmark AIRSAR data, the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art classification accuracies.

In the proposed method, The Gauss filtering is combined with log-ratio to impair speckle. Then the difference map (DM) of Gauss-log ratio and the difference map of ratio based on Gabor feature are fused with shearlet transform. Meanwhile, DM is decomposed to low frequency image and four high frequency images, different fusion rules are used in multi-scales images respectively, the work of noise reduction is operated with mean filtering.

Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) has the better potential to understand urban damage conditions from the viewpoint of scattering mechanism investigation. Polarimetric coherence is an important source for PolSAR data investigation. The variation of polarimetric coherence in the rotation domain along the radar line of sight contains rich hidden information which relates to target orientation diversity effect. This work focuses on the hidden signature exploration of co-polarization coherence in the rotation domain for urban damage investigation.

However, repetition intervals of radar instruments are in the order of several days for routine operations, reaching daily or higher frequencies only in tasked conditions. Therefore, to follow flood dynamics, images acquired by different sensors at different times may be beneficial. In the present work, multi-temporal SAR intensity, InSAR coherence and optical data are considered to describe a flood event occurred in the Basilicata region (southern Italy) on December 2013. In this case study, optical data have a twofold role: they allow to follow the flood dynamics (because SAR and optical data have been acquired in different dates during the inundation event), and they add information concerning the land cover of the analyzed area. The data fusion approach is based on Bayesian Networks (BNs). It is shown that the synergetic use of different information layers can help detect more precisely the areas affected by the flood, reducing false alarms and missed identifications which may affect algorithms based on data from a single source. The produced flood maps are compared to reference maps, independently obtained; the comparison indicates that the proposed methodology is able to reliably follow the temporal evolution of the phenomenon, assigning high probability to areas most likely to be flooded, reaching accuracies of up to 89%.","","978-1-5090-2370-7","10.1109/EESMS.2016.7504848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7504848","","Rivers;Synthetic aperture radar;Coherence;Optical imaging;Adaptive optics;Optical sensors;Floods","belief networks;sensor fusion;synthetic aperture radar","flood dynamics;optical data fusion;synthetic aperture radar;InSAR;Bayesian networks","","","","11","IEEE","7 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Quick response to a large-scale natural disaster such as earthquake and tsunami is vital to mitigate the further loss. Remote sensing especially the spaceborne sensors provide the solution to monitor a huge area in a short time and with regular revisit circle. Damage ranges and damage levels of the destructed urban areas are extremely important information for rescue planning after an event. Rapid mapping of the urban damage levels with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is still challenging. Compared with single-polarization SAR, fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) has the better potential to understand the urban damage from the viewpoint of scattering mechanism investigation. In radar polarimetry, dominant double-bounce scattering mechanism in urban area is primarily induced by the ground-wall structures and can reflect the changes of these structures. In this sense, urban damage level in terms of destroyed ground-wall structures can be indicated by the reduction of the dominant double-bounce scattering mechanism, which is the basis of this study. This work first establishes and validates the linear relationship between the urban damage level and the established polarimetric damage index using polarimetric model-based decomposition. Then, efforts are focused on the development of a rapid urban damage level mapping technique which mainly includes two steps of urban area extraction and polarimetric damage level estimation. The 3.11 East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami inducing great-scale destructions selected for study using multi-temporal spaceborne PolSAR data. Experimental studies demonstrate that the estimated damage levels are closely consistent to the ground-truth. The final urban damage level map for the full scene is generated thereafter. Results achieved in this study further validate the necessity of exploring fully polarimetric technique for damage investigation.","","978-1-5090-6093-1","10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7735038","","Synthetic aperture radar;Earthquakes;Tsunami;Electromagnetics;Electromagnetic scattering;Remote sensing","disasters;earthquakes;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar;tsunami","urban damage mapping;fully polarimetric SAR data;synthetic aperture radar;interpretation technique;large-scale natural disaster;remote sensing;spaceborne sensors;destructed urban areas;rescue planning;rapid mapping;urban damage levels;radar polarimetry;ground-wall structures;dominant double-bounce scattering mechanism;polarimetric damage index;polarimetric model-based decomposition;rapid urban damage level mapping;urban area extraction;polarimetric damage level estimation;east Japan earthquake;tsunami;temporal spaceborne PolSAR data","","","","","IEEE","10 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, offshore platform monitoring is discussed using multi-polarization X-band SAR imagery. For operational purposes, the analysis is undertaken using a data set of dual-polarization TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (TS-X/TD-X) imagery collected over a test site in Gulf of Mexico at low and high incidence angles. Additionally, experimental Dual Receive Antenna (DRA) bistatic quad-polarization TD-X data will be used for a more in depth analysis of the backscattering properties and detection performance of different target polarimetric detectors. The motivation behind this work is the observation that, under low incidence angle and moderate wind conditions, co-polarized channels may fail in detecting offshore platforms even when fine-resolution imagery is considered.

A semi-empirical model was used to model C- and L-band backscatter as function of total aboveground, stem and branch biomass; a linear regression model was used for P-band. Calibrated with the aid of inventory plots, the models were used to estimate total aboveground, stem, and branch biomass for each individual scene in the multi-temporal and multi-frequency stack of observations. Individual estimates were then combined using weights reflecting each scenes' sensitivity to the biomass component in question. At the plot scale, the retrieval errors were 37, 40, and 33 % for total aboveground, stem, and branch biomass in terms of the relative RMSE; the error further reduced to 33, 38, and 27 % when calibrating models per species. We find that i) the retrieval of total aboveground, stem and branch biomass benefits from the availability of multi-temporal/-frequency data as the lowest retrieval errors with the best single image (P-band) were about 6 to 8 % higher, ii) there is no benefit in estimating total aboveground biomass via independent estimates of stem and branch biomass, iii) consideration of species specific differences associated with different allocations of biomass to stems and branches allows for improving the retrieval.","","978-1-5386-3327-4","10.1109/Multi-Temp.2017.8035231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8035231","aboveground biomass;SAR;multi-frequency;multi-temporal","Biomass;Biological system modeling;Backscatter;Synthetic aperture radar;L-band;Frequency estimation","remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","multitemporal SAR data;Sweden;semiempirical model;L-band backscatter;inventory plots;total aboveground;multi-frequency stack;retrieval errors;branch biomass;calibrating models","","1","","5","IEEE","14 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A concise monitoring of these large scale structures for anomaly spotting thus requires loading and analyzing huge spatio/polarimetric multi-temporal image series. The contributions of the present paper for the sake of parsimonious analysis of such huge datasets are associated with a framework having two main processing stages. The first stage is the derivation of an index called geometric multi-wavelet total variation for fast and robust anomaly spotting. This index is useful for identifying significant abnormal patterns appearing as geo-spatial non-stationarities in multi-wavelet total variation map. The second stage consists in the proposal of a concise asymmetric multi-date change information matrix on regions associated with significant multi-wavelet total variations. This stage is necessary for a fine characterization of change impacts on existing geo-spatial structures.

However, the polarization scattering decomposition for multi-temporal PolSAR data easily causes “dimension disaster”. Hence, a neural network of sparse auto-encoder with non-negativity constraints (NC-SAE) was employed to compress the data, yielding efficient features for accurate classification. Then, a novel classifier of multi-scale feature classification network (MSFCN) was constructed to improve the classification performance, which is proved to be superior to the popular classifiers of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and supper vector machine (SVM).

In this study high accuracy of estimating subsidence on the river dikes is demonstrated, which has not been reported in those previous studies. Low backscatter and high temporal decorrelation on the grasses covering the surface of the river dike makes the estimation from SAR difficult. L-band monitoring from ALOS PALSAR data is expected to be more capable to estimate deformation of the river dike since the L-band microwave observation is robust against the grasses on the dike and against high temporal decorrelation. However intensity and coherence of backscatter signals from the river dike is very low and insufficient for accurate estimation on time-series interferometry analysis even with the L-band imagery. I developed a time-series interferometry algorithm based on L-band ALOS/PALSAR imagery and tested it on river dike subsidence estimation. Since the estimated parameter set in each pixel is not sufficiently accurate and has high variance the output parameter is calculated by averaging the values on several pixels. The result in this paper demonstrates the accuracy of the evaluated error is within almost 5mm/year, which should satisfy requirements of practical use for monitoring.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-3332-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7730560","multi-temporal interferometry;SAR;river dike;subsidence monitoring","Levee;Rivers;Monitoring;Estimation;Backscatter;L-band;Interferometry","environmental monitoring (geophysics);radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;rivers;synthetic aperture radar;time series","river dike subcidence estimation;satellite-borne multitemporal SAR interferometry;deformation monitoring;L-band monitoring;ALOS PALSAR data;river dike deformation estimation;L-band microwave observation;time series interferometry analysis;L-band imagery;L-band ALOS-PALSAR imagery","","","","11","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed algorithm is based on an adaptive parametric thresholding methodology and makes use of a hierarchical split-based approach. With this approach, the size of the tiles is not set a priori but, rather, tiles of variable size are sought so that the distribution functions attributed to classes of interest can be parameterized in a robust way. The InSAR coherence makes it possible to discriminate false alarms caused by other land cover classes that also show high backscattering values but are not coherent in time (e.g. certain types of vegetated areas). Both intensity and coherence features are obtained by averaging multi-temporal SAR series allowing thus to reduce the speckle without losing spatial resolution. The algorithm has been developed in the framework of the Urban Round-Robin exercise supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) through the ESA Land Cover Climate Change Initiative (CCI), and tested on Sentinel-1 data from five different test sites located in semiarid and arid regions in the Mediterranean region and Northern Africa.","","978-1-5386-3327-4","10.1109/Multi-Temp.2017.8035258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8035258","SAR;Building mapping;Hierarchical Split-Based Approach (HSBA);thresholding;InSAR coherence","Coherence;Climate change;Backscatter;Spatial resolution;Urban areas;Classification algorithms;Probability density function;Synthetic aperture radar","radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","automatic algorithm;multitemporal SAR features;backscattering intensity;InSAR coherence;adaptive parametric thresholding methodology;discriminate false alarms;multi-temporal SAR series;spatial resolution;Urban Round-Robin exercise;European Space Agency;ESA Land Cover Climate Change Initiative;Mediterranean region;Northern Africa","","4","","10","IEEE","14 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As traditional algorithms meet up with many challenges of time and memory cost, many new parallel algorithms have been developed based on high performance computing environment (HPC), and have been applied in many national scale tasks. In this work, we propose a novel parallel time series Sentinel-1 InSAR framework, which has improved the efficiency of Sentinel-1 data processing greatly, by making use of the unique data structure of Sentinel-1 TOPS mode and by separating different blocks in time series processing. Through tested on the Sentinel-1 IWS data in Beijing region, the proposed method has showed very good performance, and its accuracy can be well certified by comparison with GPS measurements.

Simple selection of the points with coherence greater than a specific value is, however, challenged by the presence of spatial dependence among observations. If the discrepancies in the areas of moderate coherence share similar behaviour, it appears important to take into account their spatial correlation for correct inference. Low coherence areas thus could serve as clear indicators of measurement noise or imperfections in mathematical models. Once exhibiting properties of statistical similarity, they allow for detection of observations that could be considered as outliers and trimmed from the dataset.

The MHYSAN model was calibrated using seven very high-resolution SAR (TerraSAR-X) SM outputs ranging over only two months. Then, the simulated SM was validated using continuous thetaprobe measurements during 15 months. The high performances observed could be explained by the fact that although images were acquired during a short time range, the important soil moisture variation captured allowed a good calibration of the soil parameters.

They are planted in a wide range and account for a high proportion of the total grain output. Quick and accurate acquisition of Dryland Crop Planting area can provide decision support for agricultural production managers, provide basis for food policy formulation, and provide guarantee for national food security. Different from the initial stage of rice growth, the underlying surface water layer and rice plant can form obvious dihedral angle, which can produce strong backscatter to microwave. Intercropping and interplanting of dryland crops are common, and the planting structure is complex, so it is difficult to identify them. At present, there is a lack of research on scattering characteristics of Dryland crops, and the universality of recognition methods is also poor, which leads to the low accuracy of dry land crop recognition based on SAR data. The purpose of studying the scattering characteristics of dryland crops and their changes with time is to provide basis for the identification of dryland crops and improve the classification accuracy. This paper chooses Jizhou City, Hebei Province as the research area, and takes corn and cotton as the research objects. The full polarization RADARSAT -2 data of three phases in 2018 (July 17, August 7 and September 24) were used. The changes of basic scattering characteristics (average scattering angle, entropy, volume scattering, dihedral angle scattering, surface scattering) of crops with different target decomposition methods (Cloude-Pottier, Freeman, Yamaguchi) were studied and compared, and the proportion of basic scattering power and its changing trend at different growth stages were analyzed. The results showed that the counter-entropy of the two crops changed little in the whole growth period, and mainly consisted of surface scattering and volume scattering. For corn, with the growth of crops, the entropy and average scattering angle increased first and then decreased, the proportion of surface scattering power decreased from 67% to 48% and then increased to 55%, and the proportion of volume scattering power increased from 33% to 52% and then decreased to 45%. On August 7, the volume scattering power is greater than the surface scattering power. For cotton, with the increase of crop growth entropy and average scattering angle, the proportion of surface scattering power decreases from 66% to 54%, and the volume scattering power increases from 33% to 46%. The surface scattering power is larger than volume scattering in the whole growth period. This study will help to determine the scattering mechanism of corn and cotton, and provide reference for the study of scattering characteristics of other dryland crops.","","978-1-7281-2116-1","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820479","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820479","dryland crops;multi-temporal;scattering characteristics","Scattering;Cotton;Covariance matrices;Urban areas;Monitoring;Entropy","agriculture;crops;geophysical image processing;image classification;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;vegetation mapping","surface scattering power;rice plant;dry land crop recognition;basic scattering characteristics;average scattering angle;dihedral angle scattering;basic scattering power;volume scattering power;crop growth entropy;surface water layer;Dryland crop planting area;planting structure","","","","15","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, with an increasing spatial resolution of SAR data, the external DEM is becoming less qualified for this purpose, resulting in notable phase residues and even decorrelation in differential interferograms. Although topographic residuals can be parameterized and estimated by multi-temporal InSAR (MTInSAR) techniques, its accuracy is limited by several factors. Instead of providing accurate height information, shortening the length of baselines is an alternative for DEM phase mitigation. We propose here an MTInSAR processing framework that can retrieve the deformation time series without the estimation of topographic residuals. Within the framework, we generate a set of pseudo interferograms with near-zero baselines by integer combination and take these pseudo interferograms as observations of MTInSAR model, where deformation becomes the only signal that needs to be parameterized. The deformation time series is then retrieved directly from wrapped phases by ridge estimation with an integer ambiguity detector. It is noted that although atmospheric artifacts might be magnified during the combination, their differential components at arcs constructed with neighboring points that are not significantly enlarged. The proposed method is particularly suitable for infrastructure deformation monitoring in urban areas where no accurate external DEM is available. It also has promising potential for retrieving deformation from SAR data stacks with short acquisition intervals since the combination can enlarge the signal of interests in pseudo-observations. Semisynthetic and real data tests indicate that the proposed method has satisfied performance on DEM error mitigation and deformation time series estimation.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2925115","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41774023,41304011,41701535); Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee(grant numbers:PolyU 152232/17E); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program(grant numbers:2019YJ0224); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8782141","Deformation time series;integer combination;interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR);ridge estimation","Strain;Synthetic aperture radar;Estimation;Deformable models;Time series analysis;Radar imaging","geophysical techniques;radar interferometry;synthetic aperture radar;topography (Earth)","ridge estimation;integer ambiguity detector;differential components;infrastructure deformation;accurate external DEM;SAR data stacks;pseudoobservations;DEM error mitigation;deformation time series;minimizing height effects;deformation detection;built areas;urban areas;atmospheric artifacts;wrapped phases;MTInSAR model;integer combination;near-zero baselines;pseudointerferograms;MTInSAR processing framework;DEM phase mitigation;accurate height information;multitemporal InSAR techniques;topographic residuals;differential interferograms;notable phase residues;spatial resolution;external digital elevation model;interferometric synthetic aperture radar phase;topographic component","","6","","39","IEEE","30 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Along this and with the aim of temporal decorrelation-robust focusing, a differential tomography framework based on generalized Capon estimator is investigated. The method can cope with temporal decorrelation of the distributed environment by spatiotemporal focusing with optimal bandwidth of the distributed signal. In addition, the method employs an additional parameter for coherence channel balancing in the model of generalized Capon that benefits from it in characterizing the spatiotemporal backscattering by mitigating the inconsistency between channels. The analysis is performed with a realistic simulation of temporal decorrelation in the presence of different decorrelation sources and taking into account the dependence on the vertical structure of the forested area.

Due to that crop acreage information is the important basis for making national food policy and economy plan, therefore, it is very important that conduct the study on crop identification. In view of the advantages of high temporal resolution, wide coverage and low cost, remote sensing has been used in a wide arrange of earth observation activities and thus provides a useful tool for crop recognition and planting acreage monitoring at a large scale. Since the 1980's, optical remote sensing has been widely used to identify various crops, however, optical images are not often available in the key growth period of crops, owing to the cloudy and rainy weather. Thus, it has a negative effect on the accuracy and timeliness of crop area monitoring. As a new high-technology with an advantage of all-weather, all-time, high resolution and wide coverage, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely applied in agricultural condition monitoring field and thus provides a strong complement and support for crop identification in data and technology aspect. As the updating and improvement of function parameters and performance index of radar sensors, it has been an important field of agriculture remote sensing that getting the information of crop sown acreage, growing condition and yield by SAR. In this paper, according to a mainline that the development progress of radar technology in the recent twenty years, the progress of studies and applications on crop discrimination by SAR is systematically summarized, and the conclusion includes 4 aspects: the first is early studies (from the late 1980's to 2002), are characterized by using single band, single polarization and multi-temporal SAR data for crop identification; The second is crop acreage monitoring based on multi-polarization, multiband SAR data, furthermore, the section can be divided into 2 subsections: one is crop recognition by multi-polarization SAR, the other is using multiple SAR sensors to crop classification; The third is studies on improving the accuracy and efficiency of crop identification by combining SAR with optical remote sensing; The last is the studies on crop classification algorithm using SAR data. According to the summary of previous studies, the problems existing in the crop identification by SAR can be analyzed as follows: the first is that crop type identified by SAR are still single; the second is that the accuracies of crop identification are not high yet; the last is that mechanism studies on classification algorithm are lack. Furthermore, the development trends are presented in this study. Dry-land crop discrimination using SAR images under a complex crop planting structure, improving the accuracy and timeliness of crop identification by optimizing the operational parameters (e.g. polarization, frequency and incidence angle) of SAR system and combining with optical remote sensing, developing the mechanism-based algorithm of crop classification will be 3 contents urgently need to be studied in the future.","","978-1-4673-8087-4","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2015.7248111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7248111","synthetic aperture radar (SAR);crop identification;multi-polarization;multiband;classification algorithm","Agriculture;Synthetic aperture radar;Remote sensing;Classification algorithms;Monitoring;Accuracy","agriculture;condition monitoring;crops;image classification;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","crop identification;synthetic aperture radar;SAR;crop yield estimation model;crop acreage information;crop recognition;optical remote sensing;agricultural condition monitoring;classification algorithm","","2","","76","IEEE","10 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, owing to various reasons, there is inevitable loss of information for whatever difference image and actually helpful to change detection. To address such drawbacks, in this paper, an unsupervised change detection approach for SAR images is proposed based on clustering with the relationship of different scale. Primarily, the similarity of difference images is defined by radial basis function (RBF). In order to use complementary information from a mean-ratio image and a log-ratio image, the third difference image is generated by fusion processing. Before all the pixels are classified into changed and unchanged regions by k-means, the difference images are considered as features of the ground truth and their contributions to classification are given by RBF. Furthermore, making use of the statistical analysis and Markov Random Fields (MRF) of pixels, the most likely change pixels are classified to change class and the most likely unchanged pixels to another, the final change detection map is obtained. Experimental results obtained on two real SAR multi-temporal image sets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique.","2158-2297","978-1-5386-9490-9","10.1109/ICIEA.2019.8833683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8833683","image change detection;radial basis function (RBF);Markov Random Fields (MRF's);Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)","Radar polarimetry;Synthetic aperture radar;Production;Discrete wavelet transforms;Markov random fields;Detection algorithms;Speckle","geophysical techniques;Markov processes;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar","radial basis function;ground truth;statistical analysis;Markov random fields;unchanged regions;changed regions;log-ratio image;mean-ratio image;SAR images;unsupervised change detection approach;synthetic aperture radar image change detection;SAR multitemporal image sets;final change detection map;change pixels","","","","25","IEEE","16 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this way of selecting sample inevitably introduces erroneous labels and imbalance between unchanged and changed classes, thus causing deterioration in change detection performance. To mitigate these issues, we have proposed a SAR change detection network based on visual saliency and multi-hierarchical fuzzy clustering. Specifically, with multi-dimensional difference feature representations, a visual saliency based difference map is constructed for accurate difference feature extraction. By integrating neighborhood information and hierarchical clustering, the multi-hierarchical fuzzy local information C-means clustering algorithm has been developed to identify potential changed regions for sample selection. A class-balanced adaptive focal loss has further been incorporated into the network training to obtain accurate predictions. Extensive experiments and comparisons on five datasets have been performed.

Satellite remote sensing data, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery, have been used for identifying landslides. SAR data possess several benefits, such as the ability to penetrate the clouds, operate day and night, and regular revisit time. However, processing SAR data require large amounts of data downloaded to the local system to be processed on a local computer. This study explored the SAR-based amplitude change detection approach using multi-temporal and multi-orbit (ascending and descending) Sentinel-1 data to identify landslides utilizing the cloud computing platform of Google Earth Engine (GEE), which aimed to assist in rapid response in mapping and inventorying landslide location data. This study took two case studies in the Lebak Regency, Banten Province, and Masamba Regency, South Sulawesi Province. Additional topographic data was used to filter out the flat areas which were unlikely to suffer from landslides. For comparison, this study also identified landslides using Sentinel-2 supported optical images on the GEE platform. In this study, the overall value of landslide mapping accuracy is 97.66% on Sentinel-2 and 68.75% on Sentinel-1 for the case study in the Lebak Regency, Banten Province. In comparison, the case study in the Masamba Regency, South Sulawesi Province, shows the overall value of landslide mapping accuracy of 96.69% in Sentinel-2 and 87.6% on Sentinel-1. Thus, the benefits of Sentinel-2 over Sentinel-1 are associated with the resulting accuracy. Still, optical-based images have a weakness in quick response efforts because optical images require sunlight and cloud/shadow-free conditions to spot landslides accurately.","2474-2333","978-1-7281-7333-7","10.1109/APSAR52370.2021.9688356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9688356","Landslide Mapping;Synthetic Aperture Radar;Google Earth Engine;Sentinel-1;Sentinel-2","Optical filters;Earth;Cloud computing;Laser radar;Satellites;Optical imaging;Terrain factors","cloud computing;disasters;geomorphology;geophysical image processing;geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;geophysics computing;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;terrain mapping","landslide mapping accuracy;Sentinel-2 data;landslides identification;Google Earth Engine;accurate landslide mapping;landslide events;satellite remote sensing data;optical imagery;identifying landslides;SAR data;SAR-based amplitude change detection approach;Sentinel-1 data;inventorying landslide location data;South Sulawesi Province;additional topographic data;identified landslides;Sentinel-2 supported optical images","","","","46","IEEE","26 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the first time, a co-polarization ratio-based parameter is used to characterize the scattering from man-made structures, which usually exhibit both reflection symmetry and asymmetry. The parameter was firstly derived from a symmetric scattering model, and in this study we analyze this parameter under the refection asymmetric case, where the target helicity angle is taken into consideration.

One way to monitor this forest is to estimate its aboveground biomass (AGB). This study aims to estimate the AGB of the largest single mangrove forest in the Philippines located in the municipality of Del Carmen, Siargao Islands using remotely sensed Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IfSAR) datasets and Sentinel-1 image. There were three predictor variables derived from the Sentinel -1 image used for modeling the AGB: the backscatter value from VV polarization, backscatter value from VH polarization, and the combination of the backscatter values from VV and VH polarizations. Also, the predictor variable from IfSAR dataset that was used is the canopy height. Linear regression between the field-measured AGB and the predictor variables was used to generate AGB model, and the coefficient of determination (r2) and root mean square error (RMSE) were determined. The results show that the model derived from IfSAR data obtained a coefficient of determination of 0.42 and RMSE of 19.39 Mg/ha. However, the combination of the two polarizations derived from Sentinel-1 image was more accurate in estimating AGB since it obtained the highest r2 of 0.43 and lowest RMSE of 12.65 Mg/ha. Based on the best model the estimated above ground biomass of whole mangrove forest ranged from 73.37 Mg/ha to 225.51 Mg/ha with an average of 140.2 Mg/ha.

Snow cover extent monitoring has been one such application where microwave sensors have been a popular choice due to their sensitivity toward the dielectric property. Snow is a dynamic matter since its dielectric state is dependent on climatic factors prevailing locally around it. In the literature, the polarization fraction (PF) has been used for landcover characterization. In this paper, we utilize the seasonal variation of the PF for mapping snow cover over the Himalayan terrain. Temporal variation of the strength in the polarized return due to change in landcover and season is the prime motivation behind this approach. In addition, the effect of SAR data acquisition time on mapping algorithms is considered in this work which is seldom discussed in the literature. Furthermore, a study is conducted to analyze the seasonal variation in the entropy ($H$) and the scattering type ( $\alpha$) parameters over the bare snow-covered ground and the forested areas. The seasonal response of the terrain in the $H/\alpha$ plane corresponding to specific scattering characteristics is analyzed. The applicability of the approach is tested with RADARSAT-2 (FQ28) C-band full polarimetric image pairs over the Manali-Dhundi region, Himachal Pradesh, India, located in the western Hindu-Kush Himalayas.

To this extent, ground-based non-destructive testing (NDT) methods have been successfully applied for decades, reaching very high standards of data quality and accuracy. However, routine and systematic campaigns are required over relatively long inspection times for data collection and implementation into reliable infrastructure management systems (IMSs). On the other hand, satellite remote sensing techniques, such as the Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) method, have proven effective in monitoring ground displacements of transport infrastructures (roads, railways and airfields), with a much higher temporal frequency of investigation and wider inspection catchment areas. Nevertheless, the integration of information from i) satellite remote sensing and ii) ground-based NDT methods is still a subject to be explored in civil engineering. Within this framework, this paper aims to review significant stand-alone applications in these two areas of technology for transport infrastructure monitoring.

Increasing the number of samples in the local window can improve the estimation bias, but cause the loss of the estimated images spatial resolution. The limitations of these estimators lead to unclear contour of the disturbed region, and even the omission of fine change targets. In this paper, a CCD approach is proposed to detect fine scene changes from multi-temporal and multi-angle SAR image pairs. Multi-angle CCD estimator can improve the contrast between the change target and the background clutter by jointly accumulating singleangle alternative estimator results without further loss of image resolution. The sensitivity of detection performance to image quantity and angle interval is analyzed.

Recent algorithms (SqueeSAR, CAESAR, and PD-PSInSAR) claim to jointly process PS and DS. SqueeSAR algorithm applies a threshold based on the statistically homogenous pixels (SHP), which prevents only the PS pixels having single-bounce scatterer from inclusion in DS processing, but the remaining types of PS pixels cannot be preserved. The included PS pixels lose their coherent information during phase history optimization in DS processing. In this paper, a new measure, the similar time-series interferometric phase (STIP) pixel is used for the identification of brotherhood pixels, which improves the classification of interferometric pixels and coherence estimation. The application of STIP instead of SHP significantly improves the phase optimization efficiency of DS pixels while retaining valuable information of PS more effectively. Furthermore, to optimize the interferometric phase of DS pixels, a least squares model is developed, which is more time efficient as compared to the Maximum likelihood estimators of the conventional DS processing techniques.

The time series spans one year (May 2015 to May 2016) and thus covers an entire seasonal cycle, including dry and wet season. For calibration and validation purposes, use is made of in situ fuel biomass values measured as part of the 2016 veld condition assessment (VCA) in KNP. From a methodological perspective, the satellite and reference data are fed into a random forests machine learning approach to make park-wide predictions of herbaceous biomass and to assess modeling performance based on Sentinel-1 imagery. A wall-to-wall herbaceous biomass map of KNP is presented for the period of investigation (i.e., 2015/2016). It has a spatial resolution of 20 m and is the most detailed product available for the park to date. According to the results of a ten-fold cross validation, the generated map is fairly reliable but still leaves room for improvement.

Using a foreshortening mask is a suitable solution, but finding the mask is challenging. The aim of this research is to exploit the fusion of Sentinel-1 multi-temporal images and SRTM DEM to produce a quasi-global foreshortening mask using the Google Earth Engine (GEE), cloud-based platform. The mean value of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 images is calculated. Then a local minimum algorithm finds probable foreshortening area. Aspect and slope information from SRTM DEM are used to refine Sentinel-1 derived foreshortening mask.

Accurate and timely acquisition of information on dryland crop types, planting areas and spatial distribution in dryland can provide an important basis for agricultural production and management, as well as the formulation of national food policy and economic plan, therefore, it is of great significance for promoting structural reform of agricultural supply side and national food security. The key stage of crop growth in the north of China is affected by cloud and rain weather, which makes it difficult to obtain sufficient effective optical data, and the current recognition accuracy of dryland crops based on polarized SAR data is low. In order to solve these problems, this study selected Jizhou City, Hebei Province as the research area, using the full-polarization RADARSAT -2 data of July 17, August 7 and September 24, 2018, and then selected three polarization decomposition methods (Cloude-Pottier decomposition, Freeman decomposition and Yamaguchi decomposition) and two classification methods (maximum likelihood and random forest) to construct 18 classification combinations. The identification of corn and cotton in study area was studied by using various schemes. Finally, the accuracy of dry land crop identification under various combination schemes was compared quantitatively with the ground survey data. The results showed that, Yamaguchi decomposition combined with maximum likelihood classification method was used on August 7 (flowering and boll period of cotton), and the classification accuracy was the highest (production accuracy was 78.98%). For corn, Yamaguchi decomposition combined with random forest classification method was used on September 24 (mature period of corn), and the classification accuracy was the highest (production accuracy was over 90%). I For the decomposition method, Yamaguchi decomposition has the highest classification accuracy among the three decomposition methods, followed by Freeman decomposition, Cloude-Pottier decomposition has the lowest classification accuracy; as far as the classification method is concerned, the maximum likelihood classification method has the highest recognition accuracy for cotton, but the random forest classification has the highest recognition accuracy for corn; in terms of the best identification phase, the flowering and boll period is the best recognition period for cotton, and the maturity period is the best recognition time for corn.. This study will help to improve the recognition accuracy of corn and cotton in fully polarized SAR data, and provide reference for the identification of multi-temporal dryland crops under complex planting structures.","","978-1-7281-2116-1","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820662","dryland crop identification;polarization decomposition;multitemporal","Scattering;Cotton;Covariance matrices;Clouds;Urban areas;Monitoring","agriculture;crops;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;vegetation mapping","dryland crop recognition;multitemporal polarization SAR data;planting area;wide spatial distribution;grain production;dryland crop types;agricultural production;national food policy;economic plan;national food security;crop growth;cloud;rain weather;sufficient effective optical data;current recognition accuracy;polarization decomposition methods;Cloude-Pottier decomposition;Freeman decomposition;Yamaguchi decomposition;corn;cotton;dry land crop identification;ground survey data;maximum likelihood classification method;production accuracy;random forest classification method;mature period;decomposition method;recognition period;maturity period;recognition time;fully polarized SAR data;multitemporal dryland crops;complex planting structures;classification accuracy;recognition accuracy;classification combinations;full-polarization RADARSAT-2 data","","1","","15","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The unrest that lasted for over a year, demonstrated substantial amounts of uplift, justifying the volcanic origin of the activity. The continuation of the deformation monitoring after the unrest event was deemed necessary, in order to validate the post-unrest state of the volcano and to recognize potential ground deformation signals. The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission is profoundly promising towards this direction, due to its systematic acquisition and short revisit. A multi-temporal SAR interferometric analysis was deliberated in a way to avoid significant phase changes and to retain high coherence. In this paper, DInSAR analysis was applied over Santorini to retrieve the actual deformation state of the volcano during the repose period 2014-2017.

We formulated the temporal decorrelation model that accounts for the random motion and dielectric changes. By applying the model into the multi-temporal coherence before the event, we extracted the temporal decorrelation components induced by natural phenomena. Based on the extracted parameters, their decorrelation probabilities related to natural changes were estimated in canopy and ground. The model parameters are also extracted from the interferometric SAR data acquired across the event. We compared probabilities between the natural phenomena and the certain event in order to assign the changed regions. Pixels with cumulative probabilities greater than 80% are selected as changed due to the event.

The Interferometric SAR coherence allows discriminating false alarms caused by other land cover classes characterized by high backscattering values which are not coherent in time (e.g. certain types of vegetated areas).

The normalized difference of intensity correlation coefficient (NDIC), normalized difference of interferometric coherence coefficient (NDCC), co-seismic intensity correlation (IC) and difference in the backscattering coefficient (DBC) images were used in order to create damage maps. In this investigation, histogram of damaged and intact building in the values of NDIC, NDCC and statistical distribution of IC-DBC were analyzed with different window size of correlation coefficients r and local mean values m. It was found that damaged buildings are better detectable with NDIC and NDCC variables than IC-DBC.

It is a basaltic shield volcano with a summit caldera of dimension 5×6.5 km. Recently, the volcano erupted on January 12, 2020, preceded by a seismic shock of magnitude 4.7 at a depth of 5 km. The subsequent seismic activities have led to the formation of a circumferential fissure below the La Cumbre crater's eastern rim, at an elevation of 1.3-1.4 km. The lava flow has occurred down the flank to the sea through this fissure. This volcanic episode has continued up to 9 hours. The InSAR time series method is a multi-temporal InSAR technique used to detect slowly occurring deformations with a millimeter level of precision using a stack of SAR interferograms. In this paper, the Differential InSAR has been used to analyze Fernandina volcano's surface deformation due to this recent eruption. The interferograms of the volcano before, during, and after the eruption have been analyzed in detail using the freely available Sentinel 1 C-band datasets from 2019 December 17 to 2020 February 09. The integration of all these analyses gives an insight into the underground magma conduit system, the correlation between the magmatic and seismic activities, surface deformations, and the lava flow channels, which have been discussed in detail in this paper.","","978-1-7281-3114-6","10.1109/InGARSS48198.2020.9358954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9358954","DInSAR;Deformation;Crater;Seismic;circumferential eruption;fissure;lava","Sea surface;Time series analysis;Geoscience and remote sensing;Volcanoes;Synthetic aperture radar;Strain;Interferometry","deformation;geomorphology;geophysical techniques;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;seismology;synthetic aperture radar;time series;volcanology","Fernandina volcano;active volcano;Galapagos archipelago;basaltic shield volcano;summit caldera;January 12, 2020;seismic shock;subsequent seismic activities;circumferential fissure;La Cumbre crater;volcanic episode;InSAR time series method;multitemporal InSAR technique;SAR interferograms;Differential InSAR;recent eruption;freely available Sentinel 1 C-band datasets;magmatic activities;surface deformations;lava flow channels;DInSAR","","","","9","IEEE","23 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among others, the small-scaled change detection method is a topic of high interest in military applications for establishing future national security systems. SAR images are distinguished from optical images due to the complex nature of the inherent phase information in conjunction with amplitude parameters. The performance of detection of changes through SAR imaging are highly dependent upon both ACD(Amplitude Change Detection) and CCD(Coherence Change Detection). The ACD method, based on measurement of amplitude, is the most common approach. It simplifies the technical mechanism of imaging as it is sensitive to changes caused by artificial objects and buildings on land. The CCD method, using the information on phase, measures the extent of similarities of multi-temporal images or their coherences. In this paper, CCD algorithms are adopted to detect local changes in dense urban areas acquired from spaceborne SAR payloads.

The statistical classifiers used in these data fusion approaches are also transformed by integrating the contextual information from neighboring pixels, to improve the accuracy of a fuzzy-logic-based fusion scheme. A decision level fusion approach was developed by Gokaraju et. al, 2012, which combines statistical methods and machine learning techniques. Here, each data sample is integrated through separate classifiers such as empirical methods and support vector machines (SVMs) and then used a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) to fuse the decisions for a unified consensus decision. The data fusion approach consists of either pixel-level or feature-level data fusion in combination with machine learning techniques for classification. The intermediate results of the disaster management studies, such as levee land-slide and tornado debris assessment using data fusion techniques, are presented in this paper. For levee landslide studies, we used the multi-temporal datasets of air-borne synthetic aperture radar sensor (UAVSAR). For Tornado disaster studies, we used multi-source and multi-temporal datasets of both synthetic aperture radar sensor (RADARSAT-2) and multispectral sensor (RapiEye) datasets.

This paper proposes a new unsupervised change detection framework based on the joint use of SAR and optical images. The framework exploits a contrastive learning algorithm and the assumption of the scarcity of relevant changes. The proposed architecture is a pseudo-Siamese network, which is trained to regress the feature vector of bi-temporal concatenated SAR-optical input data. The output feature vectors from two branches of the pseudo-Siamese network are used to calculate change intensity maps. Then, the binary change map is obtained by setting a proper threshold. The proposed method is validated by using a multi-sensor dataset made up of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images that is also compared with the single use of each modality image. Experimental results demonstrate improvements of the multisensor approach over single modality and confirm the potentiality of the joint use of SAR and optical images in change detection.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9553542","Change Detection;Data Fusion;Self-supervised Learning;Sentinel-1/-2;Remote Sensing","Change detection algorithms;Geoscience and remote sensing;Optical imaging;Feature extraction;Adaptive optics;Optical sensors;Synthetic aperture radar","","","","6","","7","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on multi-temporal InSAR processing, we have mapped the ground surface deformation before, during, and after the 2010 eruption. During the 3 years before the 2010 eruption, the volcano inflated at an average rate ∼1.7 cm/yr with marked higher rate of 6.6 cm/year during the 6 months prior to the 2010 eruption. The inflation is constrained to the top of the volcano. Since the 2010 eruption to Jan. 2011, the volcano has subsided for about 3 cm. The observed inflation and deflation are modeled with a Mogi and Prolate spheroid source. The source of inflation is located about 0.3–1.3 km below sea level directly underneath the crater. On the other hand, deflation source is modeled about 0.6–1.0 km depth with coeruption period. The average volumetric change was about from −2.7×10−5 to 1.9×10−6 km3/yr during the deformation event. Modified Laharz model compare to Landsat-7 ETM+ image through supervised classification method. We interpret the inflation was due to magma accumulation at a shallow reservoir beneath Sinabung.

Subsequently, the deformation characteristics of saline soil under different environmental conditions and human activity factors are compared and analyzed in detail.

Azimuth Doppler spectrum is theoretically an infinite spectrum that is not limited by bandwidth. Due to azimuth sampling, the spectrum part larger than the pulse repetition frequency is folded into a pulse repetition frequency (PRF), so it is difficult to find a solution to remove it completely using traditional methods. Especially in ocean images, the azimuth ambiguity caused by strongly scattered land, island or ship targets will affect the detection of sea targets. Aiming at the problem of loss of azimuth resolution and missing alarm caused by the coverage of target information on the sea surface while suppressing azimuth ambiguity, this paper proposes a coastal clutter and its azimuth ambiguity suppression method for SAR Images, which using SAR sensors to re-navigate the same area to obtain multi-temporal SAR images.

So far, most of the decision fusion techniques developed for the remote sensing applications have the drawback of assuming conditional independence between the classification results and integrates only two sensor data. The proposed Multi-sensor Fusion of Correlated Probabilities (MFCP) algorithm is rooted in the Baye's theorem and is the extended version of the Fusion of Correlated Probabilities (FCP) method by accounting for the cross conditional dependence between three multi-sensor information sources. At first, this dependence (or correlation) structure is efficiently formulated from the binary classification results of SVM by considering three sensor data and then finally used as weighting parameters in the proposed novel MFCP based fusion method. The proposed MFCP based fusion method is assessed in the multi-sensor land cover classification over the Beijing area. The data sets used consisted of two optical data sets (i.e., Landsat TM and CBERS) and one multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data set. We evaluated and validated our proposed methodology by comparing it with four existing fusion methods, i.e., Max rule based decision fusion method, Consensus theory based decision fusion method, SVM based decision fusion method and Tau model based decision fusion method. To further validate the effectiveness of the proposed MFCP based fusion method, we performed a significance test for kappa's between different fusion results. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed MFCP based fusion method outperformed all the compared fusion methods that do not take into account the cross conditional dependence between classifications, in terms of overall accuracy, kappa and class wise accuracies.","","978-1-5090-1479-8","10.1109/EORSA.2016.7552784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7552784","Decision fusion;Cross conditional dependence;Multi-sensor Fusion of Correlated Probabilities;significance test for kappa","Correlation;Remote sensing;Earth;Support vector machines;Satellites;Conferences;Classification algorithms","land cover;remote sensing by radar;sensor fusion;support vector machines;synthetic aperture radar","multisensor data;decision fusion method;land cover classification;remote sensing;multisensor fusion;correlated probabilities;Baye theorem;cross conditional dependence;multisensor information sources;binary classification;Beijing;multitemporal synthetic aperture radar;SVM based decision fusion;Tau model","","4","","27","IEEE","29 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent geothermal and geochemical studies suggest that the TVG is dormant-active rather than extinct, implying the eruption potential to devastate the nearby area of 7 million inhabitants. Although some geodetic tools (e.g., global positioning system and precise leveling) have been utilized to analyze the activity associated with volcanism, it is still challenging for conventional interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique to obtain clear ground surface movement at the TVG due to decorrelation and complex atmospheric delay. In this study, we present an improved multi-temporal InSAR (MTInSAR) approach to explore the temporal evolution and spatial extent of displacement at the TVG from 19 L-band ALOS/PALSAR images acquired between 2007 and 2011. Stratified atmospheric delays and orbit error are corrected with a patch-based joint model as different phase components can be separated according to their distinct spatiotemporal characteristics. The spatial deformation patterns indicate an uplift of 10 mm/year at the SW-NE ridge and subsidence with a rate of 10 mm/year at the E-W ridge. The temporal deformation variations at Mt. Chihshin and Huangzuei have high similarity with correlation coefficients of 0.9 above. This indicates that the subsidence at Mts. Chihshin and Huangzuei might be caused by released hydrothermal fluids related to tectono-magmatic activity within the hydrothermal system beneath the TVG.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3050644","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M650830); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41774023,41304011); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:PolyU152232/17E,PolyU152164/18E,MOST108-2116-M-034-004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9321539","Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR);orbital error;Tatun Volcano Group (TVG);tropospheric delay","Strain;Delays;Orbits;Global Positioning System;Remote sensing;Volcanic activity;Surface topography","deformation;geochemistry;geomorphology;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;Global Positioning System;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;volcanology","nearby area;7 million inhabitants;geodetic tools;global positioning system;precise leveling;conventional interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique;clear ground surface movement;decorrelation;complex atmospheric delay;multitemporal InSAR approach;temporal evolution;stratified atmospheric delays;patch-based joint model;spatial deformation patterns;temporal deformation variations;tectono-magmatic activity;mapping surface deformation;Tatun Volcano Group;northern Taiwan;northern coast;Taiwan Island;Taipei metropolis;recent geothermal studies;geochemical studies","","4","","39","CCBY","13 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approach is based on the exploitation of X-band TanDEM-X interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisitions. Large-scale mosaics of radar backscatter and volume decorrelation, derived from the interferometric coherence, are used as input data set for applying a classification algorithm based on the c-means fuzzy clustering. The unique data set provided by TanDEM-X is particularly suitable for this analysis due to the single-pass bistatic acquisition mode which does not suffer from temporal decorrelation. The located snow facies can then be related to the well known dry snow, upper and lower percolation, and wet snow/ablation zones. The obtained results have been verified with external snow melt data and independent multi-temporal TanDEM-X data. The proper location of the different facies finally allows to estimate the X-band penetration depth into the ice sheet from the TanDEM-X volume decorrelation mosaics.","","978-3-8007-4228-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7559416","","","","","","","","","","5 Sep 2016","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

ALOS/PALSAR and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 observation has been conducted with less number of scenes but globally and equally in comparison to other sensors which have been widely used, such as TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed. Therefore, overcoming this problem of scene number will promote application field of them. Since the scenes cannot be merged for interferometry analysis between these sensors as they are on different orbit and with different frequency, in this study, inter-sensor time-series analysis of persistent scatterer interferometry is discussed to increase availability of the data set.

For spatial and temporal surface roughness estimation, empirical relationships between radar and soil roughness parameters (rms height “Hrms”, and Zg parameter) were proposed. Two roughness classes are identified through radar signal inversion (smooth and ploughed soils). For the retrieval of surface soil moisture at a high spatial resolution, an algorithm combing TerraSAR-X images with continuous thetaprobe measurements was proposed. Two assumptions were studied: (1) roughness variations during the radar acquisition campaigns were not accounted for; (2) a simple correction for temporal variations in roughness was included. Finally, an empirical relationship was established between the mean moisture values retrieved from the SAR images and the percentage of clay over several test fields.

In order to eliminate the scattering influence of vegetation effectively, this paper developed a modified vegetation backscattering model to retrieve vegetation-covered soil moisture based on multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 data and field measurements. This model combined the advantages of optical and radar methods by considering scattering contributions of underlying bare soil and vegetation canopy. Vegetation coverage was used to separate the scattering mechanism of the vegetation from bare soil component in a pixel. In addition, advanced integral equation method was presented to define the scattering of underlying bare soil. PROSAIL optical model was applied to calculate crown water content, which is an important variable associated with the scattering of vegetation canopy. Results demonstrated that the modified model on March 29, 2014 performed better in soil moisture retrieval than that at other growth stages with R2 of 0.806 and root-mean-square error of 0.043 m3·m-3, respectively.

Advanced remote sensing is crucial to support cost-effective emergency response activities for disaster risk assessment and management. This preliminary study, as an effort to propose a good case study in risk management, suggested that three main steps, i.e., filtering, fusing and classifying, should be adopted to perform change detection before and after a natural disaster. We fused very high-spatial-resolution multi-temporal optical images (0.6 m spatial resolution) and X-band SAR images (2.5 m spatial resolution). The study also revealed that the decision-level method, i.e. morphological transform, was the most promising in image fusion of filtered images to classify urban surfaces in tsunami damage assessment, compared with the pixel-level method, i.e. wavelet transform, and feature-level method, i.e. segmentation extraction. This paper reports, coupled with the results from the image fusion, that the preliminary results are good enough to obtain urban impervious surface estimation of a wide disaster risk area but not good enough to make clear amplitude images to identify individual buildings of dwelling zone. The proposed normalized change index (NCI), an important indicator for detecting changes, was found capable of providing better estimation of urban impervious surfaces, such as transport-related land (e.g., bridges and parking lots) and building roof tops in residential and industrial areas over a coastal zone in Rikuzen-takada City, devastated in the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake.","","978-1-4673-7676-1","10.1109/AERO.2016.7500520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500520","","Risk management;Tsunami;Synthetic aperture radar;Earthquakes;Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Optical surface waves","disasters;earthquakes;geophysical image processing;image classification;image filtering;image fusion;image resolution;remote sensing by radar;risk management;synthetic aperture radar;tsunami","image fusion;optical data;SAR data;supervised change detection;damaged urban surface conditions;tsunami event;disaster risk reduction policies;disaster risk reduction strategies;remote sensing;cost-effective emergency response activities;disaster risk assessment;disaster risk management;natural disaster;high-spatial-resolution multitemporal optical images;spatial resolution;X-band SAR images;decision- level method;morphological transform;filtered images;urban surfaces;tsunami damage assessment;pixel-level method;wavelet transform;feature-level method;segmentation extraction;urban impervious surface estimation;disaster risk area;amplitude images;individual building dwelling zone;normalized change index;urban impervious surfaces;transport-related land;building roof;residential area;industrial area;coastal zone;Rikuzen-takada City;Great East Japan Earthquake;AD 2011","","3","","35","IEEE","30 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The image time series, as results of the satellite revisiting period, gives you insights not only on a certain area, but also on its representation at different moments of time. In order to limit the issues that might arise due to irregular time sampling of multispectral data, the authors propose a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image time series for analysis. To this point, the main goal is to mine the satellite image time series (SITS) for understanding the temporal behaviour of an area in terms of evolution and persistency. The paper introduces an analytical approach, combining coherent and no coherent analysis of SAR SITS content. We propose the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to extract categories of evolution from the SAR SITS and techniques which study statistical and coherent proprieties of the targets to identify the structures with stable electromagnetic characteristics over time, named Persistent Scatterers (PS). The obtained results indicate an evolutionary character hidden inside the persistent class.

In this work, we apply a multi-source feature data approach to investigate the urban area of Istanbul, Turkey which is a megacity with an approximate 15 million inhabitant, and under strong both anthropogenic and natural pressures. In order to analyse and compare the spatial pattern of the urban footprint, different techniques are applied. Speckle divergence, backscatter and repeat pass interferometric coherence values are considered for the analysis. To this aim, L-band HH and HV polarized ALOS-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data were acquired from Japan Space Exploration Agency's (JAXA). Pixel based Random Forest Classification method was used for the urban mapping. During the classification, different scenarios have been applied using speckle divergence, backscatter and coherence information. Overall, user and producer accuracies were calculated from the error matrix. While comparing HH and HV polarimetry, in each scenario HH provided much higher accuracies than HV results. Speckle divergence and backscatter values yielded similar accuracies which is around 88% for urban class. However, coherence gave approximately 69% while it is classified individually. The contribution of coherence was extracted while coherence was stacked with speckle divergence, and the result was improved to 91%. The urban areas was extracted with a maximum accuracy of maximum 93% while all information was combined. The preliminary results allow us to obtain a comprehensive image of urban structure, and indicate that the results may reference address for further analysis of multi-temporal SAR data over large and complicated mega cities.","","978-1-5386-9448-0","10.1109/RAST.2019.8767819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8767819","ALOS-2;urban;coherence;polarimetry;classification","","geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;image classification;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","urban area extraction;ALOS-2 data;urbanization;dynamic structure;megacity;rapid detection;sustainable management;multisource feature data;strong both anthropogenic pressures;natural pressures;spatial pattern;urban footprint;different techniques;speckle divergence;repeat pass interferometric coherence values;Japan Space Exploration Agency;Random Forest Classification method;urban mapping;coherence information;producer accuracies;higher accuracies;HV results;backscatter values;similar accuracies;urban class;urban areas;maximum accuracy;urban structure;multitemporal SAR data","","","","15","IEEE","22 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Focus on this, this paper propose the intensity segregation representation model for the multi-temporal SAR image restoration. This new variational regularization model based on the intensity separation of the multi-temporal SAR image is composed of two sub-models. The first one is a variational regularization model for the intensity component of the image, where the noise is assumed to be multiplicative, and the regularization term is the total variation. A fixed point iterative algorithm is used to solve the Euler-Lagrangian equation of the first sub-model. The second sub-model is the vectorial variational regularization model for the vector component of the image, which is obtained by the assumption that the noise is multiplicative. And the vectorial total variation norm of the vector defined on the unit sphere is obtained. A partial differential equation method is used to get the differential iterative algorithm to solve the Euler-Lagrangian equation of the second sub-model. In this paper, the intensity separation model is applied to the multi-temporal SAR image despeckling. The strong scattering target is well preserved while the good efficient of despeckling is obtained. In summary, this method is proved to highly promote the ability of distinguish different kinds of surface target of the multi-temporal SAR image.","","978-0-7381-0545-1","10.1109/CISP-BMEI51763.2020.9263647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9263647","","Image restoration;Radar polarimetry;Mathematical model;Speckle;Scattering;Imaging;Iterative methods","image denoising;image enhancement;image restoration;iterative methods;partial differential equations;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar;variational techniques;vectors","regularization term;Euler-Lagrangian equation;vectorial variational regularization model;vectorial total variation norm;intensity separation model;multitemporal SAR image despeckling;intensity separated variational regularization model;multichannel image enhancement;strong scattering target distribution;intensity segregation representation model;multitemporal SAR image restoration;intensity component","","","","4","IEEE","25 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Primeval forests that remained there untouched have exceptional value. Unsustainable logging and climate change intensify forest disturbances and may cause substantial forest loss. The engagement of remote sensing allows timely monitoring and prediction of negative consequences. The leaf area index is selected from the other forest’s condition indicators to assess the forests’ quantity and disturbance. The conceptual approach for risk assessment of forest disturbance is proposed. This approach uses multiscale multi-temporal Earth observation data, such as synthetic aperture radar imagery and high-level satellite data products. The output response of the forest’s condition was restored by multivariate regression with radar backscattering coefficients, relative difference polarization index, and local incidence angle. The low-resolution leaf area index pre-developed Copernicus data products make it possible to characterize the forest’s condition without ground truth measurements. According to the elaborated methodology, a time series of the leaf area index was mapped, and risks analysis was performed according to hazard functions. A resulting risk’s gradations map is a good tool for future research and decision-making support in nature management.

The results revealed that the multi-temporal coherence approach has the promising capability to map building damage but is not as accurate for detecting building damage under a vegetation canopy. Meanwhile, the normalized burn ratio (NBR) still provides meaningful damage maps independent of the canopy, however, the accuracy was slightly lower than the multi-temporal coherence approach for the buildings not covered by the canopy.

Advanced deep learning techniques represented by deep convolutional neural network (CNN) have been utilized to enhance the application performance. One current challenge is how to adapt deep CNN model for PolSAR target detection and classification with limited training samples while keeping good generalization performance. This work attempts to contribute to this problem. The core idea is to incorporate expert knowledge of target scattering mechanism interpretation and polarimetric feature mining to assist deep CNN model training and improve the final application performance. A polarimetric-feature-driven deep CNN detection and classification scheme is established. Both classical polarimetric features and hidden polarimetric features in the rotation domain are used to drive the proposed deep CNN model. Comparison studies validate the efficiency and superiority of the proposal. For ship detection application, two methods respectively driven by classical polarimetric features and the selected polarimetric features show relatively good performances, with detection probabilities over 90.8% for Radarsat-2 data. Considering the overall detection and false-alarm probabilities, the proposed polarimetric-feature-driven CNN approach achieves even better performance. For land cover classification, the proposed method achieves the state of the art classification accuracy for the benchmark AIRSAR data. Meanwhile, the convergence speed from the proposed polarimetric-feature-driven CNN approach is about 2.3 times faster than the normal CNN method. For multi-temporal UAVSAR datasets, the proposed scheme achieves comparably high classification accuracy as the normal CNN method for train-used temporal data, while for train-not-used data it obtains average 4.86% higher overall accuracy than the normal CNN method.","1559-9450","978-4-8855-2316-8","10.23919/PIERS.2018.8597856","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8597856","","Training;Marine vehicles;Electromagnetics;Feature extraction;Object detection;Scattering;Benchmark testing","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;object detection;probability;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;ships;synthetic aperture radar","polarimetric SAR targets detection;deep convolutional neural network;PolSAR target detection;good generalization performance;target scattering mechanism interpretation;polarimetric feature mining;deep CNN model training;final application performance;polarimetric-feature-driven deep CNN detection;classical polarimetric features;hidden polarimetric features;ship detection application;selected polarimetric features;relatively good performances;detection probabilities;polarimetric-feature-driven CNN approach;land cover classification;normal CNN method;advanced deep learning technique;high classification accuracy","","6","","21","","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Taking into account the availability for free of high resolution (10 to 30 meter) optical and SAR data from different satellite, the most resource consuming task is ground data collecting. That is why the proper time of ground surveys and crop classification maps developing is very important. In the study we propose to build three crop classification maps for JECAM Ukraine test site in Kyiv region during the vegetation season. The first one is built in the middle of May to classify winter cereals and rapeseeds. The next crop classification map is developing in July to discriminate major summer crops (spring cereals, maize, soybeans, sunflowers). The final crop map is built in autumn to refine summer crops and sugar beet discrimination.

Recent trends to solve it are based on applying multi-temporal remote sensing in order to obtain reliable crop classification maps. If a radar remote sensing is used, speckle presence in the original data reduces a classification accuracy. A negative impact of speckle can be reduced by image prefiltering procedure. Recent studies carried out for Sentinel-1 imagery have shown that more efficient pre-filtering usually results in better classification. Thus, here we propose a modification of block matching three-dimensional (BM3D) filter adapted to the properties of Sentinel-1 radar data. We demonstrate that its use leads to improved classification of crops in agricultural region of Ukraine compared to earlier methods which are based on other filters.

These correlations severely impact speckle reduction methods that require uncorrelated speckle as input. Thus, spatial down-sampling is typically applied to reduce the speckle spatial correlations prior to speckle filtering.

Taking the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake as an example, the four methods based on gray histogram, GLCM, LBP, and Gabor filter are used to extract texture features and fused, then random forest classification is applied to obtain the collapse information of earthquake-damaged buildings. In addition, it is compared with the classification results of 26 texture features after principal component analysis.

It is hard to identify targets due to strong background inferences. However, targets often change over time while most background scatterers are temporally stable. With the increasing availability of multi-temporal SAR images, one can separate moving targets from the background by analyzing their temporal behavior. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to remove background clutters by developing a stable background mask. First, we investigate the temporal behavior of amplitude time series (TS) of different scatterers using three typical distributions. Then, temporally stable pixels are extracted to generate a stable background mask for the scene. We block the stable regions for each image in the amplitude TS and obtain the processed images where only unstable regions that may include targets are left. Since most background inferences are eliminated, it will help lower false alarms in the target detection procedure.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-2792-0","10.1109/IGARSS46834.2022.9884143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9884143","SAR target detection;High-cluttered environments;SAR time series;Stable background mask","Time series analysis;Geoscience and remote sensing;Object detection;Radar polarimetry;Inference algorithms;Behavioral sciences;Task analysis","object detection;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;time series","medium-resolution SAR images;strong background inferences;background scatterers;multitemporal SAR images;temporal behavior;background clutters;stable background mask;amplitude time series;different scatterers;temporally stable pixels;stable regions;processed images;target detection procedure;novel background removal method;high-cluttered environments;SAR time series;SAR target detection","","","","8","IEEE","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Polarimetric parameters with the potential to quantify the volume scattering mechanism were extracted, and then analyzed with respect to ground identified phenology for different crop types. The RF algorithm was subsequently trained based on 60% of the data, and validated using the remaining data. Results show that the crop phenology can be monitored, through the combination of multiple polarimetric parameters to build different decision trees in the RF algorithm. By averaging the estimates from multiple decision trees, the complex relative patterns between the polarimetric parameters and crop phenology were recognized, leading to appropriate estimations on crop phenology. The obtained spearman correlation coefficients between the retrieved and ground identified crop phenology were 0.94, 0.91, 0.81 and 0.89 for canola, corn, soybean and wheat, respectively.

Rigorous inspection programs and the monitoring of these infrastructures, such as reservoir dams, are essential for the safety of citizens and properties. These interventions are usually costly and time-consuming, making in many cases, virtually impossible to monitor individually each dam which may represent a potential security risk. Multi-temporal InSAR has been successfully applied in the monitoring of infrastructures affected by tunneling works, aquifer extraction, and natural phenomena (tectonics, volcanism, seism, …), among others. The great advantage of MT-InSAR is that it provides measurement uncertainties of the order of 1 mm/year, interpreting time series of interferometric phases of coherent reflectors present in the area, called Persistent Scatterers, without the need for field work or any special equipment. To demonstrate the potential and reliability of this technique, in this paper, we present the adaptation and application of MT-InSAR technique to monitor embankment dams, obtaining vertical displacements, characterizing their consolidation rates, and allowing the identification of potential problems that require further field investigation.

The maximum line-of-sight (LOS) deformation rate measured over the slope surface was up to -80 mm/year. Time series analysis of selected measurement points indicates that the cumulative deformation peaked at -113 mm. Most importantly, two significant accelerations were detected at the upper area of the Aningzhai slope before the occurrence of failure.

With increasing deployments of highly capable commercial satellites offering high spectral and spatial resolution, global coverage and site revisit rates, predictive structural instability/integrity assessment is becoming accessible at a fraction of cost of aerial and ground based solutions. This paper presents an overview of the opportunities and challenges in affordably monitoring new and longstanding large buildings, monuments and ground infrastructure. This is necessitated by increasingly intense exploitation of environmental resources, hydrogeological instabilities and risk of natural disasters in environments perturbed by human activities that has created new risks. Planetek's Rheticus® Displacement (RD) solution provides actionable, accurate assessment of land subsidence and slow changes. The underlying SPINUA (Stable Point Interferometry Even Over Unurbanized Areas) technique has already been shown to be robust in non- and scarcely urbanized areas. The talk will provide an overview of InSAR usage and multitemporal analysis processing chain to estimate ground displacement and velocity, including results from well-characterized distributed scatterers. New results are presented that combine Quantum Resonance Interferometry (QRI) SNR and SCR enhancement processing within RD computational pipeline for extending the reliability of displacement computations to complex, vegetated ground topography and reducing the number of ground fiducials. New results are presented on dataset acquired using ESA's Sentinel-l C-band InSAR instrument (with revisit time of 6 days) with high swath-width over a site in Southern Italy.
