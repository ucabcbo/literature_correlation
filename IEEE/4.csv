Specifically, the proposed approach assembles a multi -spectral data fusion scheme together with a convolutinal neural network (CNN) mapping function to project the OLCI sensor onto its corresponding spatial reference which is synthetically generated by the OLCI/MSI fusion.

However, the synergies between both multi-spectral instruments are often difficult to exploit from an operational perspective. Standard pansharpening algorithms may encounter important disadvantages due to the limited intersensor data availability in actual production environments. Moreover, the lack of a real high-resolution ground-truth for super-resolution techniques may affect the radiometric quality of the final result. In this scenario, this work investigates the viability of using the Multi-Spectral Instrument of Sentinel-2 for super-resolving data products acquired by the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument of Sentinel-3. Specifically, we define an inter-sensor image enhancement framework which combines a PCA-based component substitution pansharpening scheme with a CNN-based spatial enhancing super-resolution mapping.

Nonetheless, effectively exploiting such intersensor synergies still raises important challenges for super-resolution (SR) algorithms in terms of operational data availability, sensor alignment and substantial resolution changes, among others. In this scenario, this article sets a new SR framework for spatially enhancing S3 ocean and land color instrument (OLCI) products by taking advantage of the higher spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral instrument (MSI). To achieve this goal, we initially study some of the most important deep learning-based approaches. Then, we define a novel Level-4 SR framework which integrates a new convolutional neural network specially designed for super-resolving OLCI data. In contrast to other networks, the proposed SR architecture (termed as SRS3) employs a dense multireceptive field together with a residual channel attention mechanism to relieve the particularly low spatial resolution of OLCI while extracting more discriminating features for the large spatial resolution differences with respect to MSI. The experimental part of the work, conducted using ten coupled OLCI and MSI operational data, reveals the suitability of the presented Level-4 SR framework within the Copernicus programme context as well as the advantages of the proposed architecture with respect different state-of-the-art models when spatially enhancing OLCI products.

However, the tradeoff between spatial resolution and swath size (and hence revisit time) means that SST products derived from remote sensing measurements commonly only have a moderate resolution (>1 km). In this article, we adapt the design of a super-resolution neural network architecture [specifically very deep super-resolution (VDSR)] to enhance the resolution of both top-of-atmosphere thermal images of sea regions and bottom-of-atmosphere SST images by a factor of 5. When tested on an unseen dataset, the trained neural network yields thermal images that have an RMSE  $2-3\times $  smaller than interpolation, with a 6–9 dB improvement in PSNR. A major contribution of the proposed neural network architecture is that it fuses optical and thermal images to propagate the high-resolution information present in the optical image to the restored thermal image. To illustrate the potential benefits of using super-resolution (SR) in the context of oceanography, we present super-resolved SST images of a gyre and an ocean front, revealing details and features otherwise poorly resolved by moderate resolution satellite images.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3094117","Project SATellite data Fusion and Imaging Resolution Enhancement for coastal areas (SAT-FIRE) financed by the Malta Council for Science and Technology, for and on behalf of the Foundation for Science and Technology, through the Space Research Fund(grant numbers:SRF-2018-1S1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9487005","Data fusion;deep learning;gyre;Landsat 8;ocean front;sea surface temperature (SST);Sentinel 3;super-resolution (SR);thermal infrared","Remote sensing;Satellites;Spatial resolution;Ocean temperature;Earth;Artificial satellites;Optical imaging","geophysical image processing;image resolution;infrared imaging;neural nets;ocean temperature;oceanographic techniques;oceanography;remote sensing","enhanced super-resolution;sea surface temperature;deep learning;infrared sensors;Earth-observing satellites;spatial resolution;swath size;revisit time;SST products;remote sensing measurements;super-resolution neural network architecture;deep super-resolution;top-of-atmosphere thermal images;sea regions;bottom-of-atmosphere SST images;trained neural network;6-9 dB improvement;high-resolution information present;optical image;restored thermal image;moderate resolution satellite images;size 1.0 km;noise figure 6.0 dB to 9.0 dB","","2","","59","IEEE","15 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in coastal areas, these phenomena are complex and their analyze requires multi-spectral images with both a high spatial and spectral resolution. Unfortunately, no satellite is able to provide both at the same time. As a consequence, multi-sharpening techniques-a.k.a. fusion or super- resolution of multi-spectral and/or hyper-spectral images-were proposed and consist of combining information from at least two multi-spectral images with different spatial and spectral resolutions. The fused image then combines their best characteristics. Various methods-based on different strategies and tools-have been proposed to solve this problem. This article presents a comparative review of fusion methods applied to Sentinel-2 MSI (13 spectral bands with a spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 60 m) and Sentinel-3 OLCI (21 spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 300 m) images. Indeed, both satellites are extensively used in marine observation and, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the fusion of their data was partially investigated (and not in the way we aim to do in this paper). To that end, we provide both a quantitative analysis of the performance of some state-of-the-art methods on simulated images, and a qualitative analysis on real images.","2158-6276","978-1-6654-3601-4","10.1109/WHISPERS52202.2021.9484009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9484009","Image fusion;Remote sensing;Sentinel-2 MSI;Sentinel-3 OLCI;Simulations;Real data","Satellites;Statistical analysis;Conferences;Sea measurements;Distance measurement;Sensors;Spatial resolution","geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;hyperspectral imaging;image fusion;image resolution;remote sensing","fusion methods;multi-sharpening techniques;multisharpening methods;multisharpening techniques;simulated images;Sentinel-3 OLCI;spectral bands;fused image;spectral resolutions;hyper-spectral images;spectral resolution;high spatial resolution;multispectral images;Sentinel-2 MSI","","2","","21","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
