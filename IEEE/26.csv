Existing deep learning methods have shown their strength on sea-ice images processing like image classification. Due to the complex environment around sea-ice area, capturing large quantities of images is not easy. Besides, it's often hard to guarantee the abundance of sea-ice distribution of each different scene class, which causes unsatisfactory classification results. Therefore, it is of considerable practical value to research on sea-ice images simulation. In this paper, a distribution controllable simulation method is proposed based on generative adversarial networks for remote sensing sea-ice images. This research can help settle the problem of small sea-ice samples, as well as can provide a practical method for optical image simulation and similar type problems.","2153-7003","978-1-7281-6374-1","10.1109/IGARSS39084.2020.9323550","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801142,61971153); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:3072020CFJ0804,3072020CFJ0805); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9323550","generative adversarial networks;image simulation;remote sensing sea-ice","Sea ice;Generators;Marine vehicles;Feature extraction;Convolution;White noise;Software","geophysical image processing;image classification;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;sea ice","distribution controllable simulation method;remote sensing sea-ice images;sea-ice area;target sea;deep learning methods;image classification;sea-ice distribution;sea-ice images simulation;sea-ice samples;optical image simulation","","","","7","IEEE","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
