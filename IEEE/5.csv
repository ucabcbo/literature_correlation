In the experiment, the photonics-based radar has a bandwidth of 8 GHz, and ISAR echoes from a full observation aperture are selected to imitate the short-aperture detection and sparse aperture detection, respectively.

Tay","DSO National Laboratories, Singapore","2022 23rd International Radar Symposium (IRS)","4 Oct 2022","2022","","","241","246","Super-Resolution for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been of high interest for its applications in reducing system Size Weight and Power (SWAP) and potential to improve SAR interpretability. Yet to enable super-resolution techniques like Super Spatially Variant Apodization (SSVA), precise knowledge of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging parameters is required. Such parameters include the pixel, ground range and azimuth resolution which may be missing or tedious to parse. Moreover, these parameters are dependent on terrain relief and the effective target beam-width which may be absent in practical scenarios involving real targets. The inability to calculate sampling parameters would degrade side-lobe levels and image quality in super-resolution processing. To tackle this, we design a novel deep learning network that leverages a bi-linear sampling layer and a total variation loss that is able to directly estimate the required sampling factor without supervision. Our network is able to learn and carry out optimal side-lobe cancellation with no prior knowledge of the system or target imaging parameters. In doing so, we make it possible to carry out super-resolution on SAR images with no a-prior expert knowledge and outperform traditional algorithms in presence of imperfect expert knowledge. We validate our approach on both simulated data and a dataset (GOTCHA) collected by Airforce Research Laboratory (AFRL).","2155-5753","978-83-956020-5-4","10.23919/IRS54158.2022.9905004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905004","Unsupervised Deep Learning;Super-resolution;Signal Processing;Sidelobe cancellation","Deep learning;Knowledge engineering;Image quality;Parameter estimation;Superresolution;Imaging;Radar imaging","image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);parameter estimation;radar imaging;radar resolution;synthetic aperture radar","unsupervised deep learning parameter estimation;high fidelity Synthetic Aperture Radar Super Resolution;SAR interpretability;super-resolution techniques;Synthetic Aperture Radar imaging parameters;ground range;azimuth resolution;effective target beam-width;sampling parameters;image quality;super-resolution processing;bi-linear sampling layer;required sampling factor;target imaging parameters;SAR images","","","","18","","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Azimuth chirp signals of stationary targets will be resolved by conventional azimuth compression operation if the signals have slow-time separation larger than the reciprocal of their frequency bandwidth. Otherwise, they will be merged together and appear as a single stationary target in the SAR imaging. The scenario of close targets is modelled as a multipath problem and the corresponding time-delays are estimated using the super-resolution MUSIC algorithm. Therefore, stationary targets with close centers, which were merged by conventional azimuth compression operation, will be resolved and the azimuth resolution is considerably improved.

This issue gets particularly relevant when dealing with Stripmap mode acquisitions and with relatively low carrier frequency sensors (where relatively large bandwidth signals are more difficult to be transmitted).

Due to the longer revisit time of homologous spaceborne satellites, only an average velocity can be determined. For longer time intervals, velocities due to short-duration events such as storms are lost. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from different sources make it easy to construct image sequences with short time intervals. However, the resolution and noise level between non-homologous SAR image pairs often differ greatly. When there is a relatively large resolution difference between image pairs, the areal features between image pairs are very different, which increases the difficulty of feature registration. In this paper, a super-resolution reconstruction method is proposed to solve the problem of resolution difference between image pairs for sea ice drift. This method can significantly improve the quality of feature registration of image pairs from different SAR sensors. We demonstrate through several examples the effectiveness of the method in feature matching of large resolution difference images from different SAR sensors.","","978-1-6654-0413-6","10.1109/ICSP51882.2021.9408919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9408919","Feature matching;Image registration;Sea ice drift tracking;Super-resolution reconstruction;Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)","Image sensors;Storms;Spaceborne radar;Superresolution;Radar tracking;Radar polarimetry;Synthetic aperture radar","image reconstruction;image registration;image resolution;image sequences;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","resolution difference images;different SAR sensors;feature registration;resolution difference nonhomologous SAR image pairs;sea ice drift tracking;SAR images;longer revisit time;homologous spaceborne satellites;longer time intervals;Synthetic Aperture Radar images;image sequences;short time intervals;noise level;super-resolution reconstruction method","","1","","12","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As all the scatterers are assumed on the uniform grids, the cross-track super-resolution can be achieved by 1-D compressed sensing. In the real imaging system, however, the gridding error should be considered because the biased scatterers lead to the mismatch of the measurement matrix and affect the imaging performance. The 1-D mismatch in cross-track direction has been solved by atomic norm minimization and off-grid sparse Bayesian inference. With the development of the super-resolution methods, the 2-D super-resolution in both azimuth and cross-track direction is realized by the 2-D compressed sensing (CS) algorithms. To solve the 2-D mismatch problem, a novel 2-D mismatch compensation method for DLLA 3-D SAR is proposed. Instead of converting the 2-D matrix signals to the 1-D vectors, the proposed method directly processes the 2-D mismatch with 2-D joint model. Furthermore, the 2-D joint model with 2-D mismatch is simplified as a normal sparse linear model, which is suitable for most of the CS reconstruction algorithms. It can not only provide better reconstruction performance but also reduce the memory cost and computation load. Finally, the simulation experiments are shown to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3043523","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631019,61871396,61971434); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9289013","Array synthetic aperture radar (SAR);compressed sensing (CS);measurement matrix mismatch;super-resolution;three-dimensional (3-D) synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Synthetic aperture radar;Imaging;Azimuth;Solid modeling;Scattering;Image reconstruction;Computational modeling","compressed sensing;electromagnetic wave scattering;image reconstruction;image resolution;minimisation;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar","three-dimensional SAR;downward-looking linear array;normal sparse linear model;2-D joint model;2-D matrix signals;DLLA 3-D;2-D compressed sensing algorithms;2-D super-resolution;super-resolution methods;off-grid sparse Bayesian inference;imaging performance;gridding error;imaging system;1-D compressed sensing;cross-track super-resolution;uniform grids;cross-track direction;synthetic aperture radar;linear array three-dimensional;two-dimensional mismatch compensation","","4","","34","CCBY","9 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a deep generative adversarial network (DGAN) is proposed to reconstruct the pseudo high-resolution (HR) SAR images. First, a generator network is constructed to remove the noise of low-resolution SAR image and generate HR SAR image. Second, a discriminator network is used to differentiate between the pseudo super-resolution images and the realistic HR images. The adversarial objective function is introduced to make the pseudo HR SAR images closer to real SAR images. The experimental results show that our method can maintain the SAR image content with high-level noise suppression. The performance evaluation based on peak signal-to-noise-ratio and structural similarity index shows the superiority of the proposed method to the conventional CNN baselines.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8899202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8899202","Synthetic aperture radar;super-resolution;generative adversarial network","Radar polarimetry;Image reconstruction;Generators;Training;Generative adversarial networks","image denoising;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;radar computing;radar imaging;radar resolution;synthetic aperture radar","deep generative adversarial network;realistic HR images;adversarial objective function;synthetic aperture radar images;SAR image superresolution;noise free generative adversarial network;deep learning;DGAN;pseudo high-resolution SAR images","","7","","12","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally, the Rayleigh resolution of the elevation direction is unacceptable due to the length limitation of linear array. The super-resolution imaging algorithms within the compressive sensing (CS) framework have been extensively studied because of the essential spatial sparsity in the elevation direction. However, the super-resolution performance of the existing sparse reconstruction algorithms will deteriorate dramatically in the case of lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level or a few antenna elements. To overcome this problem, a new super-resolution imaging structure based on CS and deep neural network (DNN) for MIMO array SAR is proposed in this article. In this new algorithm, the spatial filtering based on CS is first proposed to reserve the signals only impinging from the prespecified space subregions. Thereafter, a group of parallel end-to-end DNN regression models are designed for mapping the potential sparse recovery mathematical model and further locating the true scatterers in the elevation direction. Finally, extensive simulations and airborne MIMO array SAR experiments are investigated to validate that the proposed method can realize the state-of-the-art super-resolution imaging against other existing related methods.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3000760","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1830103); National Pre-Research Foundation of China(grant numbers:61406190101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9112264","Compressive sensing (CS);deep neural network (DNN);multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);super-resolution;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);3-D imaging","Imaging;MIMO communication;Synthetic aperture radar;Neural networks;Compressed sensing","airborne radar;antenna arrays;image filtering;image reconstruction;image resolution;MIMO radar;neural nets;radar antennas;radar computing;radar imaging;radar resolution;regression analysis;spatial filters;stereo image processing;synthetic aperture radar","illuminated scene;single-pass flight;Rayleigh resolution;linear array;super-resolution imaging algorithms;compressive sensing framework;spatial sparsity;sparse reconstruction algorithms;signal-to-noise ratio;super-resolution imaging structure;deep neural network;parallel end-to-end DNN regression models;airborne MIMO array SAR experiments;MIMO array SAR 3D imaging;multiple-input multiple-output array synthetic aperture radar;3D imagery;sparse recovery mathematical model;SNR","","16","","61","CCBY","9 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The precision of the application degrades with the presence of inherent speckle and poor resolution of images from the SAR image acquisition devices. Thus, the objective of the proposed method is to develop a technique to enhance the resolution while despeckling the inherent noise, simultaneously, since the conventional super resolution methods have failed to do the same. Moreover, the works from the literature that super resolve SAR images have also neglected the signal-dependent noise model. The work proposed in this paper significantly reduces the speckle and super resolves the SAR image using an Importance Sampling Unscented Kalman Filter framework that best models the non-linearity of the system. The technique has been assessed quantitatively and qualitatively on synthetic images as well as on real SAR images. The performance evaluation based on peak signal-to-noise-ratio, structural similarity index measure, feature similarity index measure, edge preservation factor, and equivalent number of looks values throw light on the superiority of the proposed method over the standard and other recent techniques.

First, this kind of method is mainly based on the point scattering model and not suitable for characterizing the line-segment-scattering and surface-scattering features of distributed targets. Second, the hyperparameters in these methods are hard to tune to optimal values. Third, due to a large amount of calculation, these methods are difficult to apply in practice. In this article, to solve these problems, we introduce the line-segment-scatterers (LSSs) and rectangular-plate-scatterers (RPSs) in SAR echo model to develop the SAR hybrid echo model and propose two SAR parametric SR image reconstruction methods based on solving a CS problem, where three penalties are utilized to exploit the sparsity of the point scatterers, LSSs, and RPSs, respectively. At the core of the first method is a direct solver called multicomponent alternating direction method of multipliers (MC-ADMM) solver that solves the CS problem quickly and iteratively based on closed derivative expressions. In contrast, the second method maps the MC-ADMM solver into a deep unfolded neural network, i.e., the parametric SR imaging network (PSRI-Net), which is faster, and the parameters can be automatically set to the optimum. Since all the parameters of the MC-ADMM solver are learned discriminatively through end-to-end training in PSRI-Net.

Sparsity regularization methods are widely used to tackle these problems. However, these methods are of obvious limitations. The most well-known ones are their heavy computational burdens and unsatisfied stabilities. In this letter, an efficient deep network-based cross-track imaging method is proposed. When trained, the imaging process, i.e. the forward propagation of the network, is made up of simple matrix-vector calculations and element-wise nonlinearity operations, which significantly speed up the imaging.

The POCS can efficiently obtain high-resolution SAR images with enhanced details. However, the POCS requires many low-resolution SAR images of the same area to gain a better result, usually 10 to 20 images. Such requirement is very difficult to achieve when only single-polarization mode is included.

In this vein, super-resolution of ISAR images is of vital importance. However, there is a lack of datasets for polarimetric ISAR super-resolution. Focused on this issue, a real physical degradation polarimetric ISAR super-resolution dataset are constructed utilizing electromagnetic simulation data of different bandwidths and different imaging apertures. On this basis, a group residual attention network (GRAN) for polarimetric ISAR image super-resolution is constructed. The main contribution of this work falls into three parts. Firstly, a polarimetric ISAR dataset is constructed. Secondly, since the polarimetric ISAR data is complex with multiple channels, the input data is divided into four groups for convolution processing to excavate the correlation between the real and imaginary parts of the complex data. Thirdly, a non-local attention module is added to the residual block to capture the long-range dependency and extract the channel relationship.

Naturally, we name the proposed technique as the ""coprime TomoSAR"". The coprime acquisition mode requires fewer acquisitions than the uniform one for obtaining the same baseline aperture. To further improve tomographic resolution and to reject ambiguity problem induced by sparsely sampling of the coprime acquisition mode, we perform the tomographic reconstruction using the root-multiple signal classification (Root-MUSIC) algorithm. More important is that the Root-MUSIC algorithm can exploit the difference co-baseline in the tomographic reconstruction process. The exploition of the difference co-baseline ensures that the coprime TomoSAR provides comparable tomographic performance to the uniform TomoSAR when the two TomoSAR have the same baseline aperture length.

Based on the covariance matrix matching criterion, the backscatter power of forests signal and noise will be jointly solved adaptively. Through a few iterations, the exact positions of the closely spaced phase centers can be obtained to simplify the characterization of the vertical structure of the forests.

However, it cannot always derive the sparsest solution and often yields outliers in recovery. Consequently, it is usually difficult to extract true persistent scatterers straightforwardly in practice. To enhance the sparsity, we introduce iterative reweighted L1 minimization for sparse inversion. The weight factor is computed in each iteration, according to the previous tomographic magnitude to establish a more democratic penalization rule. Our simulation results indicate that the reweighted algorithm can achieve perfect recovery when noise is lower. Specifically, when the signal-to-noise ratio is equal to 5 dB, two reweighted iterations can improve the probability of true sparsity from 29.2% to 99.8% for single scatterers and from 0.2% to 95.4% for double scatterers.

Therefore, a super-resolution passive inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging framework of moving targets using the relaxation (RELAX) algorithm is proposed under the condition of few illuminators of opportunity and small rotation angle with low SNR. During this framework, the RELAX model of passive radar imaging is mathematically established, and then we apply the RELAX algorithm to extract spatial frequencies and amplitudes of different scatterers on the target.

Image super-resolution reconstruction technology can increase image resolution and expand target size to improve detection and recognition performance. Thus, we in this paper bring deep learning onto the topic of bistatic SAR image super-resolution reconstruction and propose a novel super-resolution reconstruction model (named FSRCNN) for bistatic SAR images. The proposed model is characterized by a feature extractor with different structures, a feedback feature enhancement block, and a feature fusion module. During the experiments of bistatic SAR measured data, our method is proved to perform clearer visual effects than other image super-resolution reconstruction method.

In this paper, a novel algorithm of moving target imaging is proposed to deal with both the MTRC and SA. In the scheme, a scaled Fourier dictionary is employed to represent the MTRC. A hierarchical model of statistics is used to encode the sparsity of image.

The core of this problem is the azimuth-pitch two-dimensional super-resolution processing. First, a fixed platform azimuth-pitch two-dimensional scanning radar echo model is introduced. Then, the two-dimensional convolutional echo model is transformed into a standard linear estimation form through discretization and vectorization.

For a super-resolution ISAR image for a complex perfect electric conducting (PEC) computer-aided design (CAD) model, parameter estimation methods should be applied to  $M \times N$  scattered far-field data over  $M$  frequencies and  $N$  angles, which is conventionally obtained by using the shooting and bouncing ray (SBR) technique. Therefore,  $N$ -time ray tracing processes are required for  $N$  angles, and  $M \times N$ -time field calculations are required for  $M$  frequencies. In this paper, to reduce the computation time for  $M \times N$ -time field calculations, we introduce a fast scattered far-field prediction method for a super-resolution ISAR image of a complex PEC CAD model using the SBR technique. This method consists of two main ideas. First, under the small-angle approximation, we derive a DFT-based ISAR image formula in closed form, which allows the rapid acquisition of DFT-based ISAR image through just a one-time ray tracing process at the center frequency and angle. In addition, the scattered far-field data are also obtained by inverse discrete Fourier transforming the DFT-based ISAR image without  $N$  ray tracing processes and  $M \times N$  field calculations. Second, a field truncation method is employed to suppress errors in the scattered far-field data caused by the proposed closed-form formula. Further, by applying a parameter estimation method to the scattered far-field data, a super-resolution ISAR image is obtained quickly. Simulation results for complex PEC CAD models are in good agreement with the results for the conventional method, while the computation times are tremendously reduced.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3151049","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Ministry of Education(grant numbers:2021R1I1A3044405); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9712264","Far-field calculation;one-shot ISAR imaging;super-resolution ISAR imaging;shooting and bouncing ray~(SBR) technique;scattering center extraction","Solid modeling;Superresolution;Ray tracing;Scattering;Computational modeling;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar imaging","approximation theory;discrete Fourier transforms;electromagnetic wave scattering;image resolution;object recognition;parameter estimation;radar imaging;radar resolution;radar target recognition;ray tracing;synthetic aperture radar","fast scattered far-field predictions;super-resolution ISAR image formation;shooting and bouncing ray technique;inverse synthetic aperture radar image data;ISAR automatic target recognition;parameter estimation methods;N-time ray tracing processes;complex PEC CAD model;DFT-based ISAR image formula;field truncation method;SBR technique;perfect electric conducting computer-aided design model;inverse discrete Fourier transforming","","","","32","CCBYNCND","11 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the limitation of phase ambiguity and small Doppler gradient in forward-looking region, synthetic aperture radar and Doppler beam sharpening cannot work for forward-looking imaging, while real aperture radar (RAR) has arbitrary imaging geometry. Nevertheless, restricted by the antenna aperture, azimuth resolution of RAR is coarse, super-resolution technology is required to improve its azimuth resolution. Exploiting the sparse prior information of the target, the super-resolution problem can be transformed into an L1 norm minimization problem mathematically. Iterative reweighted algorithm can effectively solve the L1 norm minimization problem by replacing L1 norm with reweighted L2 norm and computing the weight in each iteration. However, it suffers from a large computational load due to the repeated multiplications and inversions of large matrices. In this article, a fast azimuth super-resolution imaging method of RAR based on iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) with linear sketching (LS) was proposed to achieve fast super-resolution imaging of RAR. The LS theory is employed to compress echo matrix and antenna measurement matrix into much smaller matrices via multiplying them by an embedded matrix. Then, the IRLS solver was utilized to address the reconstructed objective function. Much of the expensive computation can then be performed on the smaller matrices, thereby accelerating the algorithm. Simulations and experimental data prove that the proposed algorithm can offer a time complexity reduction without loss of imaging performance.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3061430","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901090,61901092); Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xidian University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9361073","Iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS);linear sketching (LS);real aperture radar (RAR);super-resolution imaging","Azimuth;Radar imaging;Imaging;Image resolution;Superresolution;Antenna measurements;Radar","computational complexity;image reconstruction;image resolution;iterative methods;least squares approximations;matrix algebra;minimisation;radar imaging;radar resolution;synthetic aperture radar","imaging performance;smaller matrices;antenna measurement matrix;iteration;iterative reweighted algorithm;norm minimization problem;super-resolution problem;sparse prior information;super-resolution technology;azimuth resolution;antenna aperture;arbitrary imaging geometry;RAR;Doppler beam sharpening;synthetic aperture radar;Doppler gradient;region imaging;linear sketching;iterative reweighted least squares;real aperture radar;fast sparse azimuth super-resolution imaging method","","6","","52","CCBY","23 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The keystone transform is used to coarsely compensate for the target 's rotational motion and translational motion, and the deep learning algorithm is used to achieve a super-resolution image. The uniformly distributed point target data are used as the data set of the training u-net network.

Many of the published cross-range scaling algorithms are based on the fast Fourier transformation (FFT). However, the FFT technique is resolution limited, so that the FFT-based algorithms will fail in the rotation velocity (RV) estimation of the slow rotation target. In this paper, we propose an accurate cross-range scaling algorithm based on the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method. We first select some range bins with the mono-component linear frequency modulated (LFM) signal model. Then, we dechirp the signal of each selected range bin into the form of sinusoidal signal, and utilize the super-resolution MUSIC technique to accurately estimate the frequency. After processing all the range bins, a linear relationship related to the RV can be obtained. Eventually, the ISAR image can be scaled. The proposal can precisely estimate the small RV of the slow rotation target with low computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposal can also be used in the case of cross-range scaling for the sparse aperture data.

This enables us to utilize a dynamic synthetic aperture (DSA) scheme to extract the characteristics of the true and false targets. Dictionaries about the true and false targets are constructed by taking interactions between scatterers into account. Then a sparsity-driven optimization problem is solved to reconstruct the true and false targets separately with super-resolution.

Compressive sensing (CS)-based algorithms are generally considered as the state-of-the art in super-resolving TomoSAR, in particular in the single look case. This superior performance comes at the cost of extra computational burdens, because of the sparse reconstruction, which cannot be solved analytically, and we need to employ computationally expensive iterative solvers. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning-based super-resolving TomoSAR inversion approach,  $\boldsymbol {\gamma }$ -Net, to tackle this challenge.  $\boldsymbol {\gamma }$ -Net adopts advanced complex-valued learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (CV-LISTA) to mimic the iterative optimization step in sparse reconstruction. Simulations show the height estimate from a well-trained  $\boldsymbol {\gamma }$ -Net approaches the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) while improving the computational efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude comparing to the first-order CS-based methods. It also shows no degradation in the super-resolution power comparing to the state-of-the-art second-order TomoSAR solvers, which are much more computationally expensive than the first-order methods. Specifically,  $\boldsymbol {\gamma }$ -Net reaches more than 90% detection rate in moderate super-resolving cases at 25 measurements at 6 dB SNR. Moreover, simulation at limited baselines demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms the second-order CS-based method by a fair margin. Test on real TanDEM-X data with just six interferograms also shows high-quality 3-D reconstruction with high-density detected double scatterers.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3164193","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201908080038); European Research Council (ERC), Acronym: So2Sat(grant numbers:ERC-2016-StG-714087); Helmholtz Association through the Framework of Helmholtz AI–Local Unit “Munich Unit at Aeronautics, Space and Transport (MASTr)”(grant numbers:ZT-I-PF-5-01); Helmholtz Excellent Professorship “Data Science in Earth Observation-Big Data Fusion for Urban Research”(grant numbers:W2-W3-100); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in the framework of the International Future AI Laboratory through the “Artificial Intelligence for Earth Observation (AI4EO): Reasoning, Uncertainties, Ethics and Beyond”(grant numbers:01DD20001); German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology in the framework of the “National Center of Excellence ML4Earth”(grant numbers:50EE2201C); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745947","Complex-valued learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (LISTA);compressive sensing (CS);synthetic aperture radar~(SAR) tomography (TomoSAR);super-resolution","Synthetic aperture radar;Superresolution;Deep learning;Neural networks;Reflectivity;Imaging;Image reconstruction","compressed sensing;deep learning (artificial intelligence);image reconstruction;iterative methods;optimisation;radar computing;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar;tomography","moderate super-resolving cases;second-order CS-based method;SAR tomographic inversion;synthetic aperture radar tomography;dense urban areas;high-resolution SAR acquisitions;compressive sensing-based algorithms;single look case;extra computational burdens;sparse reconstruction;deep learning;shrinkage thresholding algorithm;iterative optimization step;γ-Net approaches;Cramér-Rao lower bound;computational efficiency;first-order CS-based methods;super-resolution power;first-order methods;second-order TomoSAR solvers;high-quality 3D reconstruction;superresolving SAR tomographic inversion;complex-valued learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm;iterative optimization;TanDEM-X data;six interferograms;high-density detected double scatterers","","5","","44","CCBY","1 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To improve the resolution and reduce the sidelobes in elevation, the HoloSAR imaging mode requires many passes in elevation, thus decreasing its feasibility. In this article, an imaging method based on iterative adaptive approach (IAA) and generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is proposed for the HoloSAR with limited elevation passes to achieve super-resolution reconstruction in elevation. For the elevation reconstruction in each range-azimuth cell, the proposed method first adopts the nonparametric IAA to retrieve the elevation profile with improved resolution and suppressed sidelobes. Then, to obtain sparse elevation estimates, the GLRT is used as a model order selection tool to automatically recognize the most likely number of scatterers and obtain the reflectivities of the detected scatterers inside one range-azimuth cell. The proposed method is a super-resolving method. It does not require averaging in range and azimuth, thus it can maintain the range-azimuth resolution. In addition, the proposed method is a user parameter-free method, so it does not need the fine-tuning of any hyperparameters. The super-resolution power and the estimation accuracy of the proposed method are evaluated using the simulated data, and the validity and feasibility of the proposed method are verified by the HoloSAR real data processing results.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.2994201","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571447); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9099001","3-D imaging;generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT);holographic synthetic aperture radar (HoloSAR) tomography;iterative adaptive approach (IAA)","Image resolution;Apertures;Image reconstruction;Signal resolution;Synthetic aperture radar;Tomography;Three-dimensional displays","geophysical image processing;image reconstruction;image resolution;iterative methods;radar imaging;radar interferometry;radar resolution;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar","holographic SAR tomography 3-D reconstruction;iterative adaptive approach;generalized likelihood ratio test;holographic synthetic aperture radar tomography;attractive imaging mode;3-D scattering information;observed scene;azimuth angle variation;sidelobes;HoloSAR imaging mode;imaging method;GLRT;elevation passes;super-resolution reconstruction;elevation reconstruction;range-azimuth cell;nonparametric IAA;elevation profile;sparse elevation estimates;model order selection tool;detected scatterers;super-resolving method;range-azimuth resolution;user parameter-free method;super-resolution power","","12","","28","IEEE","22 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Emerging applications, such as freehand imaging, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imaging, and automotive SAR, face several unique challenges for high-resolution imaging. First, recovering a SAR image requires knowledge of the array positions throughout the scan. While recent work has introduced camera-based positioning systems capable of adequately estimating the position, recovering the algorithm efficiently is a requirement to enable edge and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Efficient algorithms for near-field SAR have been developed; however, they suffer from image defocusing under position estimation error and can only produce medium-fidelity images.

The most commonly used 30 m resolution shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) is usually required to be resampled due to its relatively low resolution (LR) comparing to the high resolution (HR) SAR images. Although the WorldDEM with a 12 m resolution achieves global coverage, it is not available freely. Consequently, it is useful to evaluate the practicability of the super-resolution (SR) from LR SRTM DEMs to HR WorldDEM ones, which has not been investigated. Most existing DEM SR models are trained with synthetic datasets in which the LR DEMs are downsampled from their HR counterparts. However, these models become less effective when applied to real-world scenarios due to the domain gap between the synthetic and real LR DEMs. In this article, we constructed a real-world DEM SR dataset, where the LR and HR DEMs were collected from SRTM and WorldDEM, respectively. An enhanced SR generative adversarial network model was adapted to train on the dataset. Considering that the real LR-HR pairs may suffer from misalignment, we introduced the perceptual loss for better optimizing the model. Moreover, a logarithmic normalization was proposed to compress the wide elevation range and adjust the uneven distribution. We also pretrained the model using natural images since collecting sufficient HR DEMs is costly. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near 0.69 dB improvement of peak signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, our method is also validated to improve the topographic phase simulation by 23.42% of MSE.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3105123","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41971278); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:CUHK14504219,CUHK14206818,AoE/E-603/18); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFC1510400); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9516888","Deep learning;digital elevation model;generative adversarial network;InSAR topographic phase simulation;super resolution (SR)","Generative adversarial networks;Synthetic aperture radar;Adaptation models;Training;Superresolution;Earth;Satellites","digital elevation models;geophysical image processing;image resolution;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;topography (Earth)","synthetic datasets;LR DEMs;real-world DEM;SR dataset;enhanced SR generative adversarial network model;LR-HR pairs;world DEM super-resolution;generative adversarial networks;improving InSAR topographic phase simulation;deformation estimation;differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry;relatively low resolution comparing;high resolution SAR images;LR SRTM DEMs;HR WorldDEM ones;DEM SR models;30 m resolution shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model;HR DEMs","","5","","54","CCBY","18 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, we investigate certain important properties of SR-PSI. First, we review the main workflow and dataflow of SR-PSI.

We then discuss the density and positioning accuracy of PS when compared with traditional PSI. The theory and experimental results indicate that SR-PSI can increase the PS density in urban areas.

Selecting the optimal imaging time interval to shorten the coherent processing interval (CPI) can reduce the complexity of motion errors, but the imaging resolution is affected as well, i.e., the motion error complexity and imaging resolution are constrained by each other. To address this problem, this article proposes a novel inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging framework for complex maneuvering ship targets to achieve the integration of super-resolution (SR) ISAR imaging and fine motion compensation (ISRFMC) under high sea state. With regard to the complex maneuvering motion of ship targets, we analyze the motion errors caused by the time-variant rotational velocity and imaging projection plane (IPP) on the echo signals, respectively, and a fine phase error model is established to uniformly represent the dual time-variant characteristic (DTVC) of complex maneuvering ship targets. Moreover, a deformed Akaike information criterion (DAIC) is developed to realize the adaptive selection of the phase error model with the image sharpness as the objective function. Underpinned by the Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) theory, the SR ISAR imaging can be realized by solving a sparsity-driven optimization problem via a modified quasi-Newton solver. Particularly, the fine phase errors are constructed as the model errors of image reconstruction, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is utilized to solve the maximum image sharpness optimization problem in order to perform the joint fine motion compensation and azimuth scaling (JFMCAS). ISRFMC or the integration of SR ISAR imaging and fine motion compensation can be achieved through alternate iteration, so as to obtain well-focused and scaled high-resolution ISAR images of complex maneuvering ship targets under high sea state. Extensive experiments based on both simulated and real data verify that the proposed algorithm is capable of addressing the conflict between imaging resolution and motion error complexity under high sea state.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3147266","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101407,61701379); Fund for Foreign Scholars in University Research and Teaching Programs (the 111 Project)(grant numbers:B18039); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9695466","Complex maneuvering ship targets;fine motion compensation;high sea state;inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR);super-resolution (SR) imaging","Imaging;Marine vehicles;Radar imaging;Motion compensation;Sea state;Complexity theory;Signal processing algorithms","Bayes methods;image reconstruction;image resolution;motion compensation;particle swarm optimisation;radar imaging;radar resolution;ships;synthetic aperture radar","super-resolution ISAR imaging;complex maneuvering ship targets;high sea state;complex maneuvering motion;optimal imaging time interval;motion error complexity;inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging framework;time-variant rotational velocity;imaging projection plane;fine phase error model;SR ISAR imaging;image reconstruction;maximum image sharpness optimization problem;joint fine motion compensation;particle swarm optimization algorithm","","2","","47","IEEE","27 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, by analyzing the independent relationship between beam scanning and radar signal propagation, the radar echo signal is decomposed into two-dimensional convolution relationship along the distance direction and the azimuth direction. Then, according to the low-resolution characteristics of the scanning radar and the distribution of target position, the scene and the echo signal are mapped into a unified coordinate system.

In particular by transforming them into a 3-D, 4-D, and in general Multi-Dimensional SAR image. The resolution in the higher dimensions, for instance in elevation and time, depends on the size of the elevation aperture and on the temporal separation which will be spanned by the different repeat paths. However, for more recent space-borne SAR systems which has sub-meter range resolution, like COSMO-Skymed or TerraSAR-X, the orbital tracks are tightly controlled so that they show only a small variation. According to this, the tomographic resolution in elevation is an order of magnitude lower than in range or azimuth. This is normally not a problem as only the strongest reflector is of interest. However, for urban scenes or man made objects one can expect that each azimuth-range cell consists of a few point-like scatterers in the elevation direction. To resolve these scatterers super-resolution algorithms are required to improve the performance of tomographic tools. Due to the present of only a few scatterers we can use compressive sensing (CS) techniques for reconstructing the elevation for tomographic images. This paper presents an adapted CS method for 4-D tomographic SAR and compares it with classical matched filter. Super-resolution properties of the proposed CS is proven by results obtained from simulations and from real TerraSAR-X data.","","978-1-4799-7420-7","10.1109/CoSeRa.2015.7330254","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7330254","Compressive Sensing (CS);SAR Tomography;Super-Resolution;Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR);Differential SAR Tomography;DInSAR","Synthetic aperture radar;Tomography;Image resolution;Compressed sensing;Coherence;Azimuth;Signal resolution","compressed sensing;image resolution;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar","multi scatterer detection;tomographic SAR;compressive sensing approach;synthetic aperture radar;tomographic resolution;compressive sensing techniques;tomographic images","","2","","29","IEEE","19 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main contribution of this paper is to rigorously establish that nested arrays provide lower Cramér-Rao bounds than a ULA (with the same number of sensors) in the low SNR regime, and therefore can lead to better resolvability of closely spaced sources. Numerical experiments are performed to validate theoretical claims, including demonstration of MUSIC spectra with two closely-spaced sources using ULA and nested arrays in various SNR settings.1","2379-190X","978-1-7281-7605-5","10.1109/ICASSP39728.2021.9413426","Office of Naval Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9413426","Super-Resolution;Synthetic Aperture;Nested Arrays;direction-of-arrival (DOA) Estimation;Cramér-Rao Bound","Upper bound;Array signal processing;Superresolution;Signal processing algorithms;Apertures;Multiple signal classification;Speech processing","array signal processing;image resolution;radar receivers;radar resolution;sensor placement;signal classification;synthetic aperture radar","noisy super-resolution;low SNR settings;sensor placement;sparse nested array;difference co-arrays;virtual apertures;super-resolution aperture synthesis techniques;noise levels;Cramer-Rao bounds;MUSIC spectra","","2","","26","IEEE","13 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The latter allows achieving super resolution, along with ambiguity levels reduction, thanks to the use of parametric focusing methods, as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and statistical regularization techniques, like the maximum-likelihood-inspired adaptive robust iterative approach (MARIA). Nevertheless, in order to correctly suit the considered signal model, MUSIC and most regularization approaches require an appropriate setting of the involved parameters. In both cases, the accuracy of the retrieved solutions depends on the right selection of the assigned values. Thus, with the aim of dealing with such an issue, this article addresses several parameter selection strategies, adapted specifically to the TomoSAR scenario. Parametric techniques as MUSIC solve the TomoSAR problem in a different manner as the regularization methods do, hence, each approach demands different methodologies for the proper estimation of their parameters. Consequently, we refer to the Kullback-Leibler information criterion for the model order selection of parametric techniques as MUSIC, whereas we rather explore the Morozov's discrepancy principle, the L-Curve, the Stein's unbiased risk estimate, and the generalized cross-validation to choose the regularization parameters. After the incorporation of these criteria to MUSIC and MARIA, respectively, their capabilities are first analyzed through simulations, and later on, utilizing real data acquired from an urban area.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3042661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9281339","Generalized cross-validation;information criteria;L-Curve;maximum likelihood (ML);model order selection (MOS);synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and tomography (TomoSAR)","Multiple signal classification;Synthetic aperture radar;Focusing;Inverse problems;Tomography;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Signal resolution","direction-of-arrival estimation;inverse problems;iterative methods;maximum likelihood estimation;radar signal processing;remote sensing by radar;signal classification;synthetic aperture radar;tomography","parameter selection criteria;tomo-SAR focusing;synthetic aperture radar tomography inverse problem;direction-of-arrival estimation theory;super resolution;ambiguity levels reduction;parametric focusing methods;MUSIC;statistical regularization techniques;maximum-likelihood-inspired adaptive robust iterative approach;MARIA;signal model;regularization approaches;parameter selection strategies;TomoSAR scenario;parametric techniques;TomoSAR problem;different manner;regularization methods;proper estimation;Kullback-Leibler information criterion;model order selection;Stein's unbiased risk estimate;regularization parameters","","5","","35","CCBY","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These issues are especially severe when SAR measurement is contaminated with impulsive noise. To tackle the problem, in this paper, we propose a robust polarimetric SAR imaging method with attributed scattering priors in the framework of compressive sensing. In this scheme, the overcomplete dictionary is formed by taking advantage of the physically relevant attributed scattering center (ASC) model, which is capable to represent the electromagnetic behaviors of man-made assemblies. By using the robust data-fitting model and employing the joint sparsity of multiple polarization measurements, the problem of estimating ASC attributes can be converted into robust group sparse recovery via ℓ1-ℓ2,1 optimization. To solve this formulation efficiently, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers framework via exploiting the proximity operator of complex ℓ1 norm and ℓ2 norm functions for complex-valued SAR images. Finally, the super-resolution SAR image is achieved via spectrum extrapolation based on the estimated ASC attributes. The proposed technique can enhance the SAR image features arising from the non-ideal scattering components of the target and gain robust performance to impulsive noise. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2912035","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771108); National Science and technology major project(grant numbers:2016ZX03001022); Foundation of Sichuan Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:18ZDYF0990); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8693816","Synthetic aperture radar (SAR);impulsive noise;compressive sensing (CS);attributed scattering center (ASC) model;alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)","Radar polarimetry;Synthetic aperture radar;Image reconstruction;Computational modeling;Electromagnetic scattering;Dictionaries","extrapolation;image resolution;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;synthetic aperture radar","robust group sparse recovery;nonideal scattering components;impulsive noise;robust polarimetric SAR imaging method;attributed scattering characterization;conventional ideal point model-based synthetic aperture radar imaging techniques;object-level information loss;polarimetric dependence;canonical scatterers;SAR measurement;attributed scattering priors;physically relevant attributed scattering center model;robust data-fitting model;complex-valued images;super-resolution image;ASC attributes;alternating direction method of multipliers framework;spectrum extrapolation","","4","","28","OAPA","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we pioneered the construction of the low-level feature to discriminate the ships and complemented the super-resolution (SR) denoising techniques in the network modules, termed low-level feature guided network (LFG-Net), for precise ship instance segmentation in SAR images. LFG-Net consists of the low-level feature concerned pyramid (LFCP), the high-resolution feature interaction module (HR-FIM), and the compression recovery segmentation branch (CRSB). LFCP extends the vanilla feature pyramid network (FPN) with the  ${P_{1}}$  layer and complements SR techniques to capture the regional and texture information at the image level for small object segmentation. HR-FIM interacts with the bounding box region of interest (RoI) feature and mask RoI feature at the instance level with HR techniques to enhance the mask RoI feature. CRSB aims at recovering the HR mask predictions to improve the ship segmentation performance. Comprehensive experiments on high-resolution SAR images dataset (HRSID), polygon segmentation SAR ship detection dataset (PSeg-SSDD), and AirSARShip indicate that LFG-Net* achieves 11.7%, 6.3%, and 12.7% AP increments compared with the Mask R-CNN baseline, respectively.

Aiming at this problem, monopulse imaging technology based on super-resolution in Doppler domain is proposed in this paper, which utilizes Doppler gradient differences caused by relative movement between targets and radar platform to separate targets in different azimuth. Conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) method is adopted to convert the signal into the Doppler domain, but it suffers from low resolution and high sidelobes. Thus, an iterative adaptive estimation method based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) is proposed to suppress sidelobes in Doppler domain, achieving the preliminary separation. Then, monopulse angle measuring technology based on sum to difference ratio in Doppler domain is applied to complete the energy projection, achieving secondary separation.

In this manuscript, a spotlight mode SAR-imaging algorithm that improves far-field and near-field tomographic reconstruction resolution (and RCS extraction accuracy) is presented. This algorithm comprises the following steps: 1) the range profiles are obtained with super resolution by utilizing the band-pass matrix pencil method. 2) Back-projection, which does not require polar-to-Cartesian interpolation in the spectral domain, is used for the far-field or near-field image reconstruction. 3) Background of the reconstructed image is removed with the Otsu's thresholding. 4) Complex amplitudes and locations of the scattering centers are selected from the thresholded image with an amplitude extraction procedure. Finally, obtained scattering centers are used for RCS extraction. The simulation and measurement results show that the unfavorable effects of the point spread function are reduced with the developed algorithm, and hence, the quality of the SAR image is increased, and the accuracy of the extracted RCS is improved.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2015.2416757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070719","Back projection (BP);band-pass matrix pencil method (BPMPM);near-field;Otsu thresholding;radar cross section (RCS);synthetic aperture radar (SAR);Back projection (BP);band-pass matrix pencil method (BPMPM);near-field;Otsu thresholding;radar cross section (RCS);synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Scattering;Synthetic aperture radar;Image segmentation;Image reconstruction;Image resolution;Feature extraction;Accuracy","electromagnetic wave scattering;image reconstruction;image segmentation;radar cross-sections;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar","pencil back-projection method;far-field-near-field SAR imaging;RCS extraction;RCS measurements;SAR image;SAR-imaging algorithm;near-field tomographic reconstruction resolution;far-field tomographic reconstruction resolution;band-pass matrix pencil method;near-field image reconstruction;far-field or near-field image reconstruction;RCS extraction","","20","","20","IEEE","27 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we investigate solutions for several inverse problems encountered in SAR imaging. We propose a convex proximal splitting method for the optimization of a cost function that includes a nonconvex Cauchy-based penalty. The convergence of the overall cost function optimization is ensured through careful selection of model parameters within a forward–backward (FB) algorithm. The performance of the proposed penalty function is evaluated by solving three standard SAR imaging inverse problems, including super-resolution, image formation, and despeckling, as well as ship wake detection for maritime applications. The proposed method is compared to several methods employing classical penalty functions such as total variation (TV) and  $L_{1}$  norms, and to the generalized minimax-concave (GMC) penalty. We show that the proposed Cauchy-based penalty function leads to better image reconstruction results when compared to the reference penalty functions for all SAR imaging inverse problems in this article.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3011631","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:EP/R009260/1 (AssenSAR)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9160976","Cauchy proximal operator;convex optimization;denoising;image reconstruction;nonconvex regularization;synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging inverse problems","Inverse problems;TV;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar polarimetry;Image reconstruction;Imaging;Transforms;Climate change","concave programming;image reconstruction;image resolution;inverse problems;optimisation;radar imaging;ships;synthetic aperture radar","synthetic aperture radar imagery;climate change;environmental monitoring;high dimensional mapping;ship monitoring;planetary exploration;convex proximal splitting method;nonconvex Cauchy-based penalty;cost function optimization;forward-backward algorithm;standard SAR imaging inverse problems;image formation;ship wake detection;maritime applications;classical penalty;generalized minimax-concave penalty;Cauchy-based penalty function;image reconstruction results;reference penalty;solving SAR imaging inverse problems;nonconvex regularization","","13","","74","IEEE","6 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is a good tradeoff of the aforeproposed methods of sup-GLRT and fast-sup-GLRT on accuracy and efficiency.

This letter extends the tomographic reconstruction of the coprime TomoSAR to the atomic norm minimization (ANM) framework to pursue super-resolution. A compact ANM approach is proposed in this letter for the tomographic reconstruction of coprime TomoSAR in the presence of multiple looks data. Compared with the conventional ANM approach, the proposed approach compresses the dimension of the ANM model to a smaller size by two operations. One operation is that the equivalent covariance matrix is constructed to be conformed with the covariance matrix of the real acquisition data. The other operation is adopting the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique to reduce the look dimension of acquisition data. As a result, the compact approach reduces the computation complexity without performance loss. It is confirmed by simulation experiments.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2022.3143662","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101562); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9686674","Atomic norm minimization (ANM);coprime array;singular value decomposition (SVD);tomographic synthetic aperture radar (TomoSAR)","Geometry;Covariance matrices;Tomography;Sensor arrays;Minimization;Synthetic aperture radar;Computational modeling","covariance matrices;image reconstruction;image resolution;minimisation;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;singular value decomposition;synthetic aperture radar","atomic norm minimization framework;compact ANM approach;tomographic reconstruction;coprime TomoSAR;multiple looks data;conventional ANM approach;ANM model;equivalent covariance matrix;acquisition data;singular value decomposition technique;compact approach;efficient reconstruction approach;coprime tomographic SAR;synthetic aperture radar technique;baseline configuration;coprime array geometry;flight passes;temporal decoherence","","1","","18","IEEE","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, it is generally difficult to interpret because of the superposition of several contributions in a single SAR pixel. In this paper, a novel technique for the extraction of building layovers is first presented. It makes use of the geocoding stage embedded in the InSAR processor. It is shown that building layovers create a regular pattern in the mapping counter, a map describing the number of occurrences of a SAR pixel in the elevation model. Its exploitation yields a generation of a layover map without the use of external supports. The integration in the processor with a limited additional computational load and the capability to isolate layover signatures are additional benefits. Layover patches are then individually analyzed toward a better understanding of the complex urban signal return. A spectral estimation framework is employed to assess the slopes superimposed in the patches. Fringe-frequency estimation is involved. A set of simulations made for a nonparametric (fast Fourier transform) and a parametric (multiple signal classification) technique is performed prior to testing on real data. It is demonstrated that in X-band, for a single interferogram, just one layover contributor, when it dominates over the others, can be extracted with a sufficient accuracy.

More recently, the concept of forming inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) images while the antenna is scanning, called circular scan ISAR in this paper, has drawn attention. Circular scan ISAR enables a large coverage area, sequential imaging of multiple targets, and the formation of an image sequence of a target. However, the rapid antenna scanning results in a short accumulation time of the target and reduces the Doppler resolution of the system. This paper analyzes the limit values of the Doppler resolution improvement ratio when super-resolution imaging is performed using only the compressed sensing method by relating the limit values to the restricted isometry constant (RIC) value of the sensing matrices. The limit values are found to be relatively small when the sparsity degree of the sparse signal is relatively large. Therefore, the super-resolution imaging of ships for circular scan ISAR is carried out by extrapolating data in the azimuth direction first and then reconstructing the data via compressed sensing to obtain low side-lobe levels. Finally, the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection is performed on the matrix composed of calculated sparse coefficients to improve the signal-to-clutter noise ratio (SCNR). The simulation and real-data processing results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the presented algorithm.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2019.2913903","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFC1405600); Public Science and Technology Research Funds Projects of Ocean(grant numbers:201505002); Youth Fund of China Marine Telemetry Engineering Research Center(grant numbers:2017003); China Scholarship Fund(grant numbers:201706455032); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8703104","Circular scan ISAR mode;ISAR imaging;ship imaging;super-resolution imaging;data extrapolation;compressed sensing","Image resolution;Marine vehicles;Imaging;Doppler effect;Extrapolation;Signal resolution;Compressed sensing","airborne radar;compressed sensing;extrapolation;image reconstruction;image resolution;image sequences;radar antennas;radar detection;radar imaging;radar resolution;scanning antennas;ships;synthetic aperture radar","circular scan ISAR mode super-resolution imaging;data extrapolation;airborne radars;inverse synthetic aperture radar images;sequential imaging;image sequence;rapid antenna scanning results;compressed sensing method;restricted isometry constant value;sensing matrices;Doppler resolution;constant false alarm rate;CFAR detection;RIC value;sparse signal","","7","","43","IEEE","30 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The high resolution in range is obtained by large bandwidth pulses and similarly in the azimuth, by the rotational motion of the object. The rotational motion produces a Doppler shift, measured by the phase shift produced on a sequence of coherent pulses. Hence the azimuth resolution is determined by the Doppler discrimination using spectral analysis. In this paper, we propose an analysis technique for classification of ships, based on root-Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm, which betters the performance provided by the conventional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique for ISAR imaging.

However, the utilization of optical remote sensing data suffers from the limitation of bad weather and cloud contamination. To address aforementioned issue and enhance spatial details of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image, a novel dual-domain super-resolution image fusion method is proposed by combining improved spherically invariant random vector (ISIRV) model with generalized adaptive linear combination approximation (GALCA) technology in this study. The proposed method decomposes the task of image fusion into polarimetric and texture domain fusion by integrating polarimetric components of PolSAR image and texture detail component of panchromatic image, which can significantly improve spatial resolutions of the PolSAR image while preserving polarimetric information. The data fusion experiment is implemented with three data sets including panchromatic images of Gaofen-1 (GF-1) and Gaofen-2 (GF-2) and the quad-pol SAR data of Gaofen-3 (GF-3) and Radarsat-2. Results show that the proposed dual-domain image fusion method provides a better performance compared with state-of-the-art multisensor fusion methods (BT, PCA, GS, indusion, and PRACS) regarding qualitative and quantitative evaluations. In addition, results of image fusion are applied to image classification over agricultural and urban areas of China, which shows that classification accuracy is significantly improved when compared with the result using only the original image.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3134099","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41771377,42071295,41901286,62101219); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu(grant numbers:BK20201026,BK20210921); Science Foundation of Jiangsu Normal University(grant numbers:19XSRX006); Science and Technology Innovation Key project of Shenzhen(grant numbers:JCYJ20200109150833977); Open Research Fund of Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology(grant numbers:JS202107,JS202108); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9643026","Generalized adaptive linear combination approximation (ALCA) method;improved spherically invariant random vector (SIRV) model;polarimetric domain;super-resolution image fusion;texture domain","Image fusion;Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Spatial resolution;Optical scattering;Adaptive optics;Remote sensing","agriculture;geophysical image processing;image classification;image fusion;image resolution;image sensors;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;sensor fusion;synthetic aperture radar","state-of-the-art multisensor fusion methods;image classification;panchromatic image;optical remote sensing images;multisensor image fusion;optical remote sensing data suffers;polarimetric synthetic aperture radar image;novel dual-domain super-resolution image fusion method;spherically invariant random vector model;generalized adaptive linear combination approximation;polarimetric texture domain fusion;PolSAR image;spatial resolutions;data fusion experiment;Gaofen-1;Gaofen-2;Gaofen-3;dual-domain image fusion method","","1","","46","IEEE","8 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there is a blind zone of forward-looking imaging for conventional Doppler beam sharpening and synthetic aperture radar. Scanning radar can be utilized to obtain a real beam image of a forward-looking area and implement target detection, while its azimuth resolution is poor due to the limitation of antenna size. Besides, during the processing procedure, imaging and target detection are usually regarded as two independent parts, which means that the imaging result will directly affect the detection performance. In this article, an integrated algorithm of super-resolution imaging and target detection for forward-looking scanning radar is proposed. In this algorithm, first of all, low-rank and sparse constraints as regularization norms are incorporated into the forward-looking scanning radar imaging and the objective function is established. Subsequently, the convex theory is utilized to solve the objective function and transform the problem of simultaneous super-resolution imaging and target detection into an optimization problem. Lastly, the super-resolution imaging and the target detection results are obtained simultaneously by solving the optimization problem using the alternating direction method of multipliers.

Constrained by imaging principles, conventional high-resolution radar imaging techniques such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Doppler beam sharpening (DBS) are incapable of AFLR imaging. The real aperture radar (RAR) can obtain AFLR images using a scanning antenna, but suffers from coarse cross-range resolution. Recently, there has been much attention paid to the iterative adaptive approach (IAA), which draws from the benefits of RAR imaging and provides improved cross-range resolution. However, earlier work on the IAA imposed a convolution model on the received azimuth echo, neglecting the effect of the Doppler phase. This model mismatch degrades the imaging performance for moving platforms. To settle this problem, this paper first establishes a Doppler-convolution model of AFLR imaging, where both Doppler phase and antenna convolution effects are considered, allowing more accurate reconstruction when applying the IAA to formulate a super-resolution image. Then, a data-depended approach for Doppler centroid estimation is proposed to circumvent the problem of low estimation precision using platform motion parameters delivered by navigational devices mounted on the radar platform. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed implementation of the IAA based on the Doppler-convolution model and Doppler centroid estimation can overcome the deficiencies of the SAR and DBS techniques in the forward-looking imaging direction, and present a noticeably superior performance as compared with conventional AFLR imaging methods.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2019.2920859","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671117); Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8738819","Doppler centroid estimation;forward-looking;iterative adaptive approach;super-resolution","Imaging;Radar imaging;Image resolution;Doppler effect;Azimuth;Synthetic aperture radar","airborne radar;Doppler radar;image resolution;iterative methods;radar imaging;radar resolution","Doppler phase;imaging performance;Doppler-convolution model;antenna convolution effects;super-resolution image;Doppler centroid estimation;radar platform;imaging direction;conventional AFLR imaging methods;airborne forward-looking radar super-resolution imaging;radar imaging;imaging principles;conventional high-resolution radar;aperture radar;AFLR images;coarse cross-range resolution;RAR imaging;improved cross-range resolution","","39","","38","IEEE","18 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In practice, however, the CPI is limited by the target movement. In this work, the extent of the range and Doppler migration effects occurring when using a long CPI to integrate the returns from an L-band digital aeronautical communication system (LDACS) based passive radar is studied. In particular, our simulations underline the extensive Doppler migration effect that arises even for non-accelerating targets. To this end, the Keystone transform and fractional Fourier transform techniques are combined with the standard passive radar processing to enable the compensation of both range and Doppler migration effects. This non-model-based approach is, however, shown to have limitations, in particular for low signal-to-noise ratios and/or multitarget scenarios. To address these shortcomings, a novel model-based framework that allows to perform joint target detection and parameter estimation is developed. For this, a super-resolution sparse Bayesian learning approach is employed. This technique uses a multitarget observation model, which accurately accounts for the underlying range and Doppler migration effects and provides super-resolution estimation capabilities. This is particularly advantageous in the LDACS case since the narrow bandwidth generally limits the separation of closely spaced targets. The simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and the advantages it provides when compared to the standard migration compensation approach.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2020.3026844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9206073","Coherent processing;fractional Fourier transform (FrFT);keystone transform (KT); $L$ -band digital aeronautical communication system (LDACS);passive radar;range and Doppler migration;sparse Bayesian learning (SBL);super-resolution (SR)","Passive radar;Signal to noise ratio;Doppler effect;Bayes methods;Parameter estimation;Synthetic aperture radar","aircraft communication;Bayes methods;Doppler radar;Fourier transforms;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;parameter estimation;passive radar;radar detection;radar imaging;radar signal processing;radar tracking;target tracking","super-resolution estimation capabilities;closely spaced targets;standard migration compensation approach;long coherent integration;passive radar systems using super-resolution sparse Bayesian;coherent processing interval;performing passive radar detection;weak signal reflections;target movement;long CPI;L-band digital aeronautical communication system;extensive Doppler migration effect;fractional Fourier transform techniques;standard passive radar;Doppler migration effects;nonmodel-based approach;signal-to-noise ratios;novel model-based framework;joint target detection;parameter estimation;super-resolution sparse Bayesian learning approach;multitarget observation model;underlying range","","9","","46","IEEE","25 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, this increases considerably the system complexity and cost. In this paper, we present a novel processing scheme that combines the principle of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to a MIMO system with widely separated antennas. Exploiting multiple consecutive observations, the spatial information increases and the sidelobes are considerably mitigated. The approach is particularly suitable for naval scenarios, where the low speed of the platform and the long pulse repetition interval make the MIMO processing more indicated than SAR. A simulative analysis considering realistic parameters for a maritime application reveal a sidelobe suppression enhancement as high as 14 dB. Moreover, specific tests show that an error of 10% in the estimation of the platform speed does not affect the overall detection performance. The proposed approach appears very promising since the SAR-like data fusion allows lowering the sidelobes while preserving the high cross-range resolution enabled by the coherent MIMO processing.","","978-2-87487-057-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8904762","MIMO-SAR radar;Multi-static radar;Naval surveillance radar;Super-resolution","","MIMO radar;radar antennas;radar resolution;radar signal processing;sensor fusion;synthetic aperture radar","spatial information;coherent MIMO processing;fixed-antennas radar systems;system complexity;Synthetic Aperture Radar;MIMO system;Coherent Multi-Input MultiOutput radars;pulse repetition interval;distributed antennas;SAR-like data fusion;sidelobe suppression enhancement","","","","12","","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The resolving along the elevation direction can be treated as a line spectrum estimation problem. However, traditional super-resolution spectrum estimation algorithms require multiple snapshots and uncorrelated targets. Meanwhile, as the most popular TomoSAR imaging method in modern years, compressed sensing (CS) based methods suffer from the gridding mismatch effect which markedly degrades the imaging performance. As a gridless CS approach, atomic norm minimization can avoid the gridding effect but requires enormous computing resources. Addressing the above issues, this paper proposes an improved fast ANM algorithm to TomoSAR elevation focusing by introducing the IVDST-ANM algorithm, which reduces the huge computational complexity of the conventional time-consuming semi-positive definite programming (SDP) by the iterative Vandermonde decomposition and shrinkage-thresholding (IVDST) approach, and retains the benefits of ANM in terms of gridless imaging and single snapshot recovery.We conducted experiments using simulated data to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, and reconstruction results of an urban area from the SARMV3D-Imaging 1.0 dataset are also presented.","","978-1-83953-777-6","10.1049/icp.2022.2290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10038932","","","computational complexity;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;image reconstruction;image resolution;iterative methods;minimisation;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar;tomography","accelerated atomic norm minimization;compressed sensing based methods;conventional time-consuming semipositive definite programming;elevation direction;enormous computing resources;gridding effect;gridding mismatch effect;gridless CS approach;gridless imaging;gridless tomographic SAR;huge computational complexity;imaging performance;improved fast ANM algorithm;iterative Vandermonde decomposition;IVDST-ANM algorithm;line spectrum estimation problem;modern years;multiple snapshots;popular TomoSAR imaging method;resolving;SARMV3D-Imaging;single snapshot recovery;super-resolution spectrum estimation algorithms;synthetic aperture radar tomography;TomoSAR elevation;two-dimensional observations;uncorrelated targets","","","","","","7 Feb 2023","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The implementation of the Super-Resolution reprocessing algorithm, however, is computationally intensive, which makes SR-PSI time-consuming. In this work, we propose to improve the efficiency by constraining the Capon-based reprocessing to the non-homogeneous areas (e.g., urban areas). We notice that the Capon algorithm performs similarly as the Fourier-based algorithm for homogeneous regions (e.g., grassland), thus we can use Single Look Complex (SLC) images for these areas. With the Coefficient of Variation (CV) as the index, we divide the full image into two classes: homogeneous areas, for which we select PSCs from the original stack, and non-homogeneous areas, for which we extract PSCs from the Capon-based reprocessed images. Then we combine the PSCs of both cases for further PSI processing. We applied the combination method to a stack of TerraSAR-X data.

They are computationally expensive since they cannot be solved analytically. An emerging technique known as deep unrolling provided a good combination of the descriptive ability of neural networks, explainable, and computational efficiency for BPDN. Many unrolled neural networks for BPDN, e.g., learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm and its variants, employ shrinkage functions to prune elements with small magnitude. Through experiments on synthetic aperture radar tomography (TomoSAR), we discover the shrinkage step leads to unavoidable information loss in the dynamics of networks and degrades the performance of the model. We propose a recurrent neural network (RNN) with novel sparse minimal gated units (SMGUs) to solve the information loss issue. The proposed RNN architecture with SMGUs benefits from incorporating historical information into optimization and, thus, effectively preserves full information in the final output. Taking TomoSAR inversion as an example, extensive simulations demonstrated that the proposed RNN outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning-based algorithm in terms of super-resolution power and generalization ability. It achieved 10%–20% higher double-scatterer detection rate and is less sensitive to phase and amplitude ratio difference between scatterers.

This technology achieves the separation of the target and the environment through the near-field 3-D high-resolution imaging. And then the far-field RCS of the target can be obtained through the near-field-to-far-field transformation, therefore the technology has near-field and outer-field measurement capabilities. For imaging-based RCS measurement, its imaging accuracy is correlated with RCS measurement accuracy. The imaging resolution of the measurement system limits the accuracy of the target imaging and the reconstruction of the target shape, which in turn affects the RCS accuracy. Therefore, imaging resolution is one of the limiting factors that affect the accuracy of imaging-based RCS measurement. The current super-resolution imaging method can exceed the resolution of traditional imaging and improve the accuracy of imaging-based RCS measurement. In this paper, A RCS measurement method based on compressed sensing 3-D super-resolution is discussed. This method applies the 3-D super-resolution imaging of compressed sensing to the RCS measurement based on linear array (SAR) 3-D imaging. According to the imaging model, an appropriate observation matrix is designed, and the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is used to reconstruct the super-resolution 3-D image of the target. The image can improve the accuracy of reconstruction of the target’s shape, and then improve the accuracy of RCS obtained.

Nevertheless, bistatic forward-looking imaging is seriously limited by the motion of the transmitter and receiver, resulting in a restrained resolution. In this work, the method for vortex missile-borne bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BSAR) is proposed, which combines the orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam with the traditional missile-borne BSAR technique to obtain a larger Doppler bandwidth. Higher azimuth resolution is achieved by compensating large spatial range cell migration (RCM) and serious range-azimuth coupling. Firstly, the imaging scene of vortex missile-borne BSAR and the OAM-based echo model are established and deduced. Secondly, the preprocessing method for amplitude compensation is proposed with the design of the transmitted OAM beam, which improves the uncorrelation between different pulse echoes. Then, the improved range Doppler (RD) algorithm with azimuth compensation factor is proposed for vortex missile-borne BSAR to obtain the super-resolution two-dimensional (2D) reconstruction for the target. Simulation results show that compared with conventional missile-borne BSAR, the proposed vortex missile-borne BSAR possessing the extending Doppler bandwidth can obtain superior azimuth resolution performance with the identical synthetic aperture length situation. Furthermore, this work will contribute to the application for OAM-carrying in the field of radar forward-looking imaging and the development for high-resolution missile-borne BSAR imaging technology.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2022.3233084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10011185","Bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BSAR);orbital angular momentum (OAM);range Doppler (RD) algorithm;two-dimensional (2D) reconstruction;super-resolution imaging","Imaging;Azimuth;Radar imaging;Synthetic aperture radar;Antenna arrays;Three-dimensional displays;Doppler effect","","","","","","","IEEE","6 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Such feature extractors are not always available due to lack of training data, especially for hyperspectral sensors and other hyperdimensional images. Moreover models trained on easily available multispectral (RGB/RGB-NIR) images cannot be reused on such hyperdimensional images due to their irregular number of bands. While hyperdimensional images show large number of spectral bands, they generally show much less spatial complexity, thus reducing the requirement of large receptive fields of convolution filters. Recent works in the computer vision have shown that even untrained deep models can yield remarkable result in some tasks like super-resolution and surface reconstruction. This motivates us to make a bold proposition that untrained lightweight deep model, initialized with some weight initialization strategy, can be used to extract useful semantic features from bi-temporal hyperdimensional images. Based on this proposition, we design a novel change detection framework for hyperdimensional images by extracting bitemporal features using an untrained model and further comparing the extracted features using deep change vector analysis to distinguish changed pixels from the unchanged ones. We further use the deep change hypervectors to cluster the changed pixels into different semantic groups. We conduct experiments on four change detection datasets: three hyperspectral datasets and a hyperdimensional polarimetric synthetic aperture radar dataset.

The emergence of very high resolution X-Band sensors has increased the interest in application to urban area. Advances of SAR interferometry has been provided by the extension toward SAR tomography. By transforming classical 2-D SAR imaging into higher dimensional (space-time) imaging, it offers the possibility to reconstruct the 3-D/4-D scattering distribution and to detect point clouds for reconstructing single buildings and infrastructures and for the monitoring of their long term deformation. The resolution provided by classical SAR tomographic methods may show limitations in the detection of point clouds. To improve the performance of the tomographic tools super-resolution Compressive Sensing (CS) algorithms have been recently proposed. The literature, however, lacks of an assessment of the improvement of CS over classical point could detection schemes based on classical matched filter as well as of possible indications about the development of a CS algorithm able to guarantee a fixed false alarm probability.

Analytical constraints for range and Doppler migration are defined by exploiting the concept of Bistatically Equivalent Monostatic (BEM) [1] and validated by means of simulated data.

A new microwave forward-looking correlated 3-D imaging method based on random radiation field combined with sparse reconstruction is proposed in this article. Firstly, phased array radar (PAR) is adopted to form different and random antenna patterns. Then, combined with the compressed sensing (CS) theory, the target image can be recovered with very few samples which can break through Rayleigh resolution limitation. Furthermore, the proposed method can achieve resolution at least 5.5 times higher than real aperture imaging. To raise computation efficiency of sparse reconstruction, an improved quasi-Newton iteration method based on graphics processing unit (GPU) platform is developed.

TomoSAR algorithms, including the CS-based ones, usually require a fairly large number of images to achieve a reliable reconstruction, because large error and especially bias occur in low number of measurements. In addition, CS-based algorithms are extremely computationally expensive due to their sparse reconstruction. These factors hinder their practical use. This paper demonstrates the potential of a novel and computationally efficient deep learning algorithm for TomoSAR on very small interferometric stacks. Investigation of the super-resolution ability shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art CS-based TomoSAR algorithm by a fair margin when limited acquisitions are available.

However, its fatal weakness is the poor angular resolution which is very important in automotive radar applications. This shortcoming can be overcome by using a physically large aperture. However, achieving moderate angular resolution requires an array that is too large to be practically integrated into a vehicle. In this paper, a high resolution direction of arrival (DOA) approach is proposed by utilizing the relative motion between radar and targets, and a very large virtual aperture can be created by combining the signal vectors from multiple consecutive coherent processing intervals (CPIs). It should be pointed out that, the proposed approach is applicable for both stationary and moving targets even without motion data of vehicles.

Considering the characteristics of the ship target and the 3-D InISAR system, the bistatic configuration is designed to avoid the imaging failure in special situations caused by the low velocity of the ship target. The specificity of the 3-D InISAR imaging technique makes the adoption of the optimal imaging time selection method based on the estimation of the Doppler center, which can help to select the imaging time when the cross-range resolution reaches maximum, effective and simple enough for the 3-D reconstruction of the ship target. Besides, the translational and angular motion compensations in such situations are explained clearly. Due to the shortness of the selected echoes caused by motion complexity of the ship target, the sparse Bayes learning method, which has a lot of advantages compared with other similar methods, is adopted to realize the super-resolution imaging for the purpose of separating the superposed scatterers and its superiority in reducing the computation load of the 3-D InISAR imaging system is demonstrated explicitly.

However, followed by the enhanced sparse feature, structures of the scenes or targets of interest in weak scattering are easily lost. Therefore, it becomes difficult to make use of the high-resolution SAR data, and even high costs have been paid for the resolution. In this article, a novel structure-guaranteed SAR (SG-SAR) imaging algorithm is proposed by utilizing the morphology metric for the cluster feature of the scatterers of the scenes/targets of interest. By introducing structural priors in terms of morphology norm, the intended structure features can be highlighted via convex regularization. More specifically, to accommodate complicated scenarios or targets, the structure element (SE) in the morphology regularizer is designed to be spatially variant under structure tensor representation. Different from conventional convex optimizations, the proposed SG-SAR algorithm is solved under the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs), which is flexible to incorporate with the super-resolution imagery. In such cases, both sparse and structural features can be simultaneously enhanced, even with limited measurements and in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Superior convergence and robustness can be guaranteed. Moreover, a grouping mask scheme is used to accommodate the complex-valued SAR data. Finally, both simulated and measured SAR data are applied for the validation. Comparisons with the conventions are performed in terms of phase transition analysis, so as to verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm both qualitatively and quantitatively.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3197439","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271487); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:61825105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9852479","Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs);morphology regularization (MR);proximity operator;structure-guaranteed synthetic aperture radar (SG-SAR)","Synthetic aperture radar;Morphology;Radar polarimetry;Convex functions;Radar imaging;Image resolution;Bayes methods","","","","","","43","IEEE","8 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the sparsity of MAF in the Doppler parameter space, a novel hierarchical basis pursuit (HBP) method is proposed to obtain high sparse recovery performance as well as computational efficiency.

To overcome this problem, a fast 2-D gridless recovery (GLR) algorithm for the 2-D imaging signal model established in the real domain is proposed in this paper. Extensive simulation results validate that the proposed 2-D real-valued gridless recovery approach can approximately improve the computational efficiency by a factor of ten in terms of CPU time when compared with that of the 2-D GLR algorithm in the complex domain.","2640-7736","978-1-6654-9814-2","10.1109/Radar53847.2021.10028034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10028034","Array SAR;Fast 3-D Imaging;Sparse signal;Gridless recovery","Computational modeling;Imaging;Radar imaging;Approximation algorithms;Mathematical models;Computational efficiency;Synthetic aperture radar","","","","","","8","IEEE","8 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Super-resolution and accurate 3-dimensional imaging method by combining EM computational analysis in short range UWB radar","S. Kidera","The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, JAPAN","2015 1st URSI Atlantic Radio Science Conference (URSI AT-RASC)","26 Oct 2015","2015","","","1","1","Electro-magnetic computational techniques are indispensable tools for advanced radar imaging techniques, especially for inverse scattering topics. As one of the most attractive topics in recent years, UWB (Ultra-wide Band) short range radar has a great potential for higher resolution imaging for short range scale, due to holding higher range resolution or favorable penetrating ability for dielectric object. There are so many demands for establishing super-resolution imaging algorithm for robotic sensor in disaster area, non-destructive testing or non-invasive biomedical imaging issues, where the spatial resolution must be remarkably enhanced for competing other internal sensing approaches, such as X-rays or ultra sound imaging. For these demands, we have already developed super-resolution and highly accurate 3-dimensional imaging methods, called as range points migration (RPM) method. The RPM method has a several important advantages comparing with the other imaging method, as synthetic aperture radar, time-reversal approach or other waveform focusing techniques. This method has been verified numerically or experimentally that it provides us super-resolution and 1/100 wavelength reconstruction accuracy by using frequency domain interference (FDI) approach, as Capon method, which is extended to correspond to the scattering waveform deformation. This paper introduces this super-resolution imaging methodologies and clarify the role of accurate EM computational technique as FDTD method for achieving 1/100 wavelength accuracy. This paper also introduces a novel inverse scattering method, namely, the reconstruction of dielectric constant distribution, by combining the unique feature of RPM boundary extraction and the efficient EM computational method. Both numerical and experimental investigations are assessed for proving the effectiveness of the proposed method.","","978-9-0900-8628-6","10.1109/URSI-AT-RASC.2015.7302943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7302943","","","","","","","","","","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

WCOM implements its observation requirements by measurement of microwave emission/scattering of both the frequencies sensitive to the key parameters and also the auxiliary frequencies providing necessary atmospheric and surface roughness corrections. In order to satisfy this measurement requirements, WCOM is equipped with payloads with combination of active and passive microwave sounding capabilities of frequency from L-band to W-band. Dual Frequency Polarized Scatterometer (DFPSCAT) is one of the three payloads onboard the satellite of Water Cycle Observation Mission (WCOM). DFPSCAT is an X/Ku band rotating pencil beam scatterometer with 2-5 km resolution and 1000km swath for mapping of snow water equivalent (SWE) and freeze-thaw process. DFPSCAT achieves fine resolution by linear frequency modulation pulse compression along the elevation direction, and by unfocused synthetic aperture processing (a technique where the Doppler effect is exploited to synthesize a longer aperture to achieve an improved resolution), as well as super-resolution reconstruction by oversampling in the direction of the azimuth. Based on the payloads of WCOM mission, especially with X/Ku scatterometer and L/Ku/Ka radiometer active/passive observations, there are obvious advantages in snow water equivalent retrieval. The atmospheric correction of active and passive data should be performed before the retrieval. The estimation of SWE mainly rely on the high resolution X and Ku band scatterometer, and combined active/passive retrieval can provide more reliable SWE product. The retrieval method of SWE from X/Ku scatterometer is described, and combined active/passive retrieval is also briefly described.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-4951-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8127214","water cycle;satellite mission;radar;snow water equivalent;snow wetness","Radar measurements;Indexes","atmospheric measuring apparatus;atmospheric techniques;hydrological techniques;image resolution;oceanographic techniques;radiometers;radiometry;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;snow;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar;wind","DFPSCAT;linear frequency modulation pulse compression;WCOM mission;snow water equivalent retrieval;snow water equivalent monitoring;dual-frequency scatterometer;ocean surface salinity;microwave scattering;active microwave measurement;passive microwave measurement;water cycle observation mission;Ku band rotating pencil beam scatterometer;X band rotating pencil beam scatterometer;Ku scatterometer;X scatterometer;radiometer passive observation;radiometer active observation;dual frequency polarized scatterometer;atmospheric surface roughness correction;global water cycle parameter;synergetic observation;passive retrieval","","","","4","IEEE","4 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared with the conventional signal model, the new method considers both the spatial sampling obtained by multi-channel receiving technique and the temporal sampling obtained by coherent pulses to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of the ground scatterers, effectively utilizing space-time two-dimensional information. Then the iterative adaptive expressions based on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion are employed to process the space-time snapshots to generate the super-resolution image of the ground.

Interferometric imaging is a relative of phase retrieval, which arises from crosscorrelating measurements from pairs of receivers. GWF provides a theoretical framework to process scattering data satisfying the Born approximation, and guarantees exact recovery of the underlying scene reflectivity vector from interferometric measurements if the discretized lifted forward model satisfies the restricted isometry property over rank-1, positive semi-definite matrices with a sufficiently small restricted isometry constant (RIC). To this end, we design a linear deterministic discrete lifted forward model for interferometric multistatic radar measurements such that the exact recovery conditions of GWF are satisfied. Our results identify a lower limit on the pixel spacing and the sample complexity for exact multistatic radar imaging. We provide a numerical study of our RIC and pixel spacing bounds on synthetic single scattering data, which show that GWF can achieve exact recovery with super-resolution. While our primary interest lies in radar imaging, our results are applicable to other multistatic wave-based imaging problems such as those arising in acoustics and geophysics.","2333-9403","","10.1109/TCI.2020.2967151","Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-16-1-0234,FA9550-19-1-0284); Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N0001418-1-2068); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1809234); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8961154","Multi-static radar;radar imaging;non-convex optimization;interferometric inversion;phase retrieval;wirtinger flow","Imaging;Radar imaging;Receivers;Scattering;Image reconstruction;Approximation methods;Multistatic radar","compressed sensing;computational complexity;geophysical techniques;gradient methods;matrix algebra;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;vectors","Generalized Wirtinger Flow;scene reflectivity vector;small restricted isometry constant;linear deterministic discrete;semidefinite matrices;restricted isometry property;interferometric measurements;Born approximation;phase retrieval;interferometric inversion problem;exact multistatic interferometric imaging;multistatic wave-based imaging problems;synthetic single scattering data;RIC;exact multistatic radar imaging;pixel spacing;GWF;exact recovery conditions;interferometric multistatic radar measurements;forward model","","10","","55","IEEE","16 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
