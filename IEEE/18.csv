We develop the GPR model on a synthetic dataset, which represents both open ocean and coastal Arctic waters. This allows the model to be exposed to and trained on data from both kinds of aquatic environments. The chosen GPR model has previously been trained and tested in a different aquatic environment, representing a variety of complexity conditions, where it was demonstrated to have strong generalization capabilities. Our results suggest that this model can also be used for diverse Arctic water conditions as well.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8899898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8899898","Ocean color monitoring;Chlorophyll-a;Machine Learning;Arctic;Sentinel 3 OLCI","Arctic;Sea measurements;Oceans;Ground penetrating radar;Monitoring;Lakes;Sea ice","ocean composition;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing","generalized Chlorophyll-a;Gaussian Process Regression;Chlorophyll-a content;synthetic dataset;open ocean;coastal Arctic waters;GPR model;aquatic environment;complexity conditions;strong generalization capabilities;diverse Arctic water conditions;complexity-diverse Arctic waters;Sentinel 3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument","","","","5","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their observations are limited to few occasional sightings and no regular dataset is published till now. In this work, we employ an existing remote sensing method which was already applied in the Arctic and for the first time detect potential surface melt areas on top of the Antarctic sea ice at a regional to global scale using Sentinel-3 data. We confirm the occurrence of melt ponds in Lützow-Holm Bay in the vicinity of the Shōwa Station observed in situ in January 2017 and detect surface melt in the following years 2018–2020. We also perform global processing of the Antarctic sea ice to detect further regions of potential surface melt.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-2792-0","10.1109/IGARSS46834.2022.9884159","German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft), Priority Program Antarctic research, SPP 1158 project REASSESS(grant numbers:424326801); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9884159","remote sensing;Antarctic sea ice;surface melt;optical retrieval;Sentinel-3","Integrated optics;Earth;Sea surface;Satellites;Antarctica;Arctic;Optical sensors","oceanographic regions;remote sensing;sea ice","sensing observations;melt ponds;Antarctic SEA ICE;Sentinel-3 data;sea ice surface;Antarctic sea ice;existing remote sensing method;potential surface melt areas","","","","10","IEEE","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Cloud filtering with MERIS and AATSR for melt pond detection on Arctic sea ice","H. Marks; G. Heygster; L.

However, they are currently poorly represented in circulation models. One of the reasons is the lack of reliable large-scale observations. A challenge encountered during melt pond retrieval from optical satellite observations is the filtering of cloud which in the visible range of spectrum look similarly bright as the sea ice surface. Here we demonstrate the influence of undetected cloud on the melt pond retrieval and suggest a masking procedure based on a Bayesian classifier trained using coincident infrared observations of AATSR. The AATSR swath only covers the central half of the MERIS swath but the masking procedure extends the filtering scheme to the outer parts of the MERIS swath so that the full swath can be used for melt pond retrieval.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-3332-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7731000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7731000","Melt ponds;sea ice;remote sensing;cloud filtering;MERIS;AATSR;Sentinel-3","Clouds;Sea ice;MODIS;Arctic;Integrated optics;Sea surface","Bayes methods;clouds;oceanographic regions;sea ice","cloud filtering;melt pond detection;Arctic summer sea ice;local radiative balance;circulation models;reliable large-scale observations;melt pond retrieval;optical satellite observations;spectrum visible range;sea ice surface;undetected cloud;Bayesian classifier;coincident infrared observations;MERIS swath;filtering scheme","","","","11","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A simple geometrical optics model is explored to show the possibility to derive the First Year sea ice parameters best fitting the experimental data. Satellite Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are used to analyze the mesoscale sea ice structure and detect the age of the sea ice samples. Sentinel-3 altimeter data along with the Metop Advanced scatterometer (ASCAT) measurements of the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) are jointly used to build the NRCS dependencies on the incidence angle for the selected sea ice samples. Sea ice drift fields are used to investigate only those regions where the drift is negligible on a single day scale. It is shown that the suggested approach presents a powerful tool to study the Arctic sea ice properties.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553828","Russian Science Foundation(grant numbers:19-17-00236); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9553828","Arctic sea ice;satellite remote sensing;First Year ice;radar backscatter incidence angle dependency","Satellites;Spaceborne radar;Salinity (geophysical);Sea measurements;Tools;Geometrical optics;Arctic","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar cross-sections;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","satellite scatterometer;SAR;Arctic saline sea ice;geometrical optics model;sea ice parameters;Satellite Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data;mesoscale sea ice structure;Sentinel-3 altimeter data;Metop Advanced scatterometer measurements;normalized radar cross section;sea ice drift fields;ASCAT measurements","","","","18","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Knowledge of sea ice type is important for climate research and safety in Arctic offshore operations.First-year ice is characterised by a low SAR backscatter intensity in both HH and HV polarisation compared to multi-year ice, while the altimeter waveform parameters show high pulse peakiness and peak power compared to multi-year ice.Thus SAR imagery and altimetry can principally discriminate different ice types. The complexity of the backscattered radar signal however impedes a clear separation of the two types for all cases. Cross comparison of the two sensors offers an opportunity of high resolution validation data, which is often lacking for sea ice studies.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8899041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8899041","Sea ice;SAR;altimeter","Backscatter;Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar polarimetry;Standards;Altimetry","backscatter;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","multiyear ice;sea ice studies;Sentinel-3 altimetry data;sea ice type discrimination;C-band SAR imagery;Sentinel-3 SRAL Ku-band altimeter data;SAR backscatter intensity;Sentinel-1 C-band SAR imagery","","","","10","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
