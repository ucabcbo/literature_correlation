These methods often fail to produce convincing results in real-world data since the actual degradation is much more complex than manually designed. This paper presents a deep learning framework to model the degradation process of microsatellite image. To this end, we first introduce remote sensing dataset consisting of WorldView (0.4m) and PlanetScope (3m) satellite images. They are aligned to the same coordinate, but are collected at different days/times. Using such data, we design Degradation Network (DegNet), generating realistic micro-satellite images from its high-resolution (HR) counterpart. A degradation loss using an optimal transport distance is proposed which makes the empirical distribution, i.e., histogram of outputs to be similar to that of real microsatellite images. It faithfully reflects the degradation characteristic of micro-satellite while preserving the content of an input. Finally, a SR network is trained with the generated LR-HR pairs. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method greatly improves the SR performance on real-world data.","2381-8549","978-1-7281-6395-6","10.1109/ICIP40778.2020.9190810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9190810","Micro-satellite image;generative models;satellite image super-resolution;optimal transport distance;degradation learning","Degradation;Remote sensing;Satellites;Histograms;Image resolution;Training;Generators","deep learning (artificial intelligence);geophysical image processing;image reconstruction;image resolution;remote sensing","low-resolution images;deep learning framework;high-resolution counterpart;optimal transport distance;degradation characteristic;LR-HR pairs;microsatellite image super-resolution;planetscope satellite images;design degradation network;SR network","","1","","27","IEEE","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deep learning algorithms have remarked as an entity for developing single image high-quality reconstruction. Super-resolution with Deep Learning algorithms has demonstrated state of the art approaches for reconstructing sharper and more accurate images. Satellite images are highly prone to lose minute details of the image when subjected to algorithmic modeling. Thus, it is necessary to preserve the details of image. In this paper, an attempt is made to incorporate the state of the art approaches for reconstructing the satellite images. This requires careful conditioning of validating parameters like bias value, weights, appropriate usage of filters and scaling factors. The existing super-resolution algorithms such as Bicubic interpolation, Super resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN), fast Super resolution convolutional neural network (FSRCNN) and Deep Laplacian Pyramid (LapSRN) are simulated to reconstruct the satellite images obtained from benchmark data sets of Indian and International satellite sensors. An extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the super-resolution algorithms shows that the Deep Laplacian Pyramid networks perform favorably against the other state-of-the-art methods exclusively for satellite images.","","978-1-5386-7401-7","10.1109/IBSSC47189.2019.8973105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8973105","Convolution Neural Networks;Deep Laplacian Pyramid;Super Resolution","","convolutional neural nets;geophysical image processing;image reconstruction;image resolution;interpolation;learning (artificial intelligence)","super-resolution algorithms;deep Laplacian pyramid networks;satellite image super resolution;deep learning techniques;single image high-quality reconstruction;deep learning algorithms;sharper images;sampling image details;SRCNN;LapSRN;FSRCNN;fast super resolution convolutional neural network;bicubic interpolation","","1","","11","IEEE","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the residual receptive field block structure is introduced in features extraction network to learn better feature representations for image colorization and SR. Residual Receptive Field Block(RRFB) is improved by expanding the receptive field and enhancing the context connection from inception model. Second, the extracted features are transformed to a color high-resolution image by a recovery architecture. In this work, U-net is employed as the key structure of the recovery architecture. Besides, the squeeze-and-excitation blocks and complex residual blocks are incorporated into the proposed model to increase the reconstruction performance. To verify the performance, our method is compared with the state-of-the-art methods of SR and colorization.

Image super-resolution plays an important role in remote sensing image processing. However, existing methods show that increasing network depth will inevitably lead to the dramatic increase of model parameters and the over-fitting problem. Besides, most methods treat different types of information (low-frequency and high-frequency) equally. Motivated by these observations, we propose a fused recurrent network via channel attention (CA-FRN) in this paper. The basic module, recursive channel attention block (RCAB), pays enough attention to the high-frequency information and diminishes the low-frequency information adaptively through channel attention. Based on RCAB, we render our model effective by retaining and fusing hierarchical local information of both low-resolution and high-resolution, and we enhance the network performance simply by increasing the number of RCABs without adding extra parameters. We evaluate the proposed model on satellite images from different datasets, and the proposed CA-FRN is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.

However, to maintain high temporal resolution, video satellite images usually sacrifice their spatial resolution. Therefore, super-resolution (SR) plays a vital role in improving the quality of video satellite images. In this article, we propose a multiframe video SR neural network (MVSRnet) for video satellite image SR reconstruction. The proposed MVSRnet consists of three main subnetworks: an optical flow estimation subnetwork (OFEnet), an upscaling subnetwork (Upnet) and an attention-based residual learning subnetwork (ARLnet). The OFEnet aims to estimate low-resolution (LR) optical flow of multiple image frames. Upnet is then constructed to enhance the resolution of both input frames and the estimated LR optical flows. Motion compensation is subsequently performed according to the high-resolution (HR) optical flows. Finally, the compensated HR cube is fed to the ARLnet to generate SR results. Different from existing video satellite image SR methods, the proposed MVSRnet is a multiframe-based method with an attention mechanism, which can merge the motion information among adjacent frames and highlight the importance of extracted features.

The price for satellite images depends on the sensor quality and revisit rate. This work proposes to bridge the gap between image quality and the price by improving the image quality via super-resolution (SR). Recently, a number of deep SR techniques have been proposed to enhance satellite images. However, none of these methods utilize the region-level context information, giving equal importance to each region in the image. This, along with the fact that most state-of-the-art SR methods are complex and cumbersome deep models, the time taken to process very large satellite images can be impractically high. We, propose to handle this challenge by designing an SR framework that analyzes the regional information content on each patch of the low-resolution image and judiciously chooses to use more computationally complex deep models to super-resolve more structure-rich regions on the image, while using less resource-intensive non-deep methods on non-salient regions. Through extensive experiments on a large satellite image, we show substantial decrease in inference time while achieving similar performance to that of existing deep SR methods over several evaluation measures like PSNR, MSE and SSIM.","","978-1-7281-9325-0","10.1109/BigMM50055.2020.00046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9232612","Fast Super-Resolution;Satellite Imagery;Deep Neural Networks","Image edge detection;Satellites;Interpolation;Spatial resolution;Training;Feature extraction;Task analysis","artificial satellites;geophysical image processing;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence)","fast super-resolution;satellite image resolution;low cost satellite imagery;image quality;deep SR techniques;state-of-the-art SR methods;low-resolution image;complex deep models;resource-intensive nondeep methods;deep SR methods;sensor quality;regional information content;nonsalient regions;inference time","","1","","17","IEEE","20 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inspired by EEGAN and based on it, the Ultra-Dense Subnet (UDSN) and Edge Enhanced Network (EEN) were modified. Among them, the UDSN is used for feature extraction and obtains high-resolution results that look clear in the intermediate but are deteriorated by artifacts, and the Edge-Enhanced Subnet (EESN) is used to purify, extract and enhance the image contour and use mask processing to eliminate images contaminated by noise.

Using remote sensing technology to identify residential areas is of great value for land resources planning and utilization, disaster prevention and relief and other fields. As the world's first high resolution optical remote sensing satellite for geosynchronous orbit, GF-4 satellite has high time resolution, medium spatial resolution and multispectral land detection capability, which provides a new data resource for residential monitoring. Closely combining with the detection characteristics of the GF-4 satellite, this paper proposes a remote sensing identification method based on GF-4 satellite, and the recognition ability of the GF-4 satellite to the residential area is analyzed. The remote sensing recognition of residential areas is mainly divided into four steps. First, Super-resolution image enhancement technology is used to improve the spatial resolution of GF-4 satellite PMS image. Then, the resolution enhanced image is processed by geometric correction, radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction. Third, the existing land use and land cover data are selected as prior knowledge to select typical sample areas. Based on the spectral characteristics and spectral relationship of different objects in GF-4 satellite image, decision tree classification method is used to eliminate the obvious non-residential areas such as cloud, vegetation, water and shadow, so as to reduce the subsequent data processing and reduce the false recognition rate in residential area. Finally, SVM classifier is selected for the classification of residential areas. Taking GF-4 satellite data in Jiashan county as experiment, the result shows that the user accuracy of resident recognition by this method is 89.96%, which is significantly higher than that without resolution enhancement in the same method. Besides, the spatial scope of the county and township residents can be effectively identified in GF-4 enhanced image.","","978-1-5386-6642-5","10.1109/EORSA.2018.8598622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8598622","GF-4;Residential area recognition;Remote sensing information extraction","Spatial resolution;Remote sensing;Satellites;Satellite broadcasting;Reflection;Image recognition","decision trees;disasters;geophysical image processing;image classification;image enhancement;land cover;land use;land use planning;remote sensing;support vector machines","residential area;GF-4 satellite image;remote sensing technology;disaster prevention;remote sensing identification method;remote sensing recognition;Super-resolution image enhancement technology;GF-4 satellite PMS image;resolution enhanced image;land cover data;nonresidential areas;GF-4 satellite data;GF-4 enhanced image;land use;decision tree classification method;residential monitoring;SVM classifier","","1","","7","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We refer to such a sensing paradigm as remote urban sensing. In this paper, we focus on a migratable satellite image super-resolution problem in remote urban sensing applications. Our goal is to reconstruct satellite images of a high resolution in a target area where the high-resolution training data is not available by transferring a super-resolution model learned in a source area where such data is available. This problem is motivated by the limitation of current solutions that primarily rely on a rich set of high-resolution satellite images in the studied area that are not always available. Two important challenges exist in solving our problem: i) the target and source areas often have very different urban characteristics that prevent the direct application of a super-resolution model learned from the source area to the target area; ii) it is not a trivial task to ensure effective model migration with desirable quality without sufficient high quality training data. To address the above challenges, we develop TransRes, a deep adversarial transfer learning framework, to effectively reconstruct high-resolution satellite images without requiring any ground-truth training data from the studied area. We evaluate the TransRes framework using the real-world satellite imagery data collected from three different cities in Europe. The results show that TransRes consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by achieving the lowest perception errors under various application scenarios.","2155-5494","978-1-7281-6630-8","10.1109/SECON48991.2020.9158410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9158410","Urban Sensing;Remote Sensing;Migratable Image Super-Resolution;Transfer Learning","Satellites;Sensors;Image reconstruction;Spatial resolution;Urban areas;Training data","geophysical image processing;geophysical signal processing;image classification;image reconstruction;image resolution;image sensors;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing","TransRes;deep transfer;migratable image super-resolution;remote sensing;powerful sensing paradigm;scalable sensing paradigm;abundant visual information;urban environments;migratable satellite image super-resolution problem;remote urban sensing applications;high-resolution training data;super-resolution model;source area;high-resolution satellite images;source areas;different urban characteristics;effective model migration;sufficient high quality training data;deep adversarial transfer learning framework;ground-truth training data;real-world satellite imagery data","","7","","39","IEEE","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Guided by recent advances in super resolution, we propose a theoretical framework that leverages the benefits of supervised and reinforcement learning. We argue that a straightforward implementation of RL is not adequate to address ill-posed super resolution as the action variables are not fully known. To tackle this issue, we propose to parameterize action variables by matrices, and train our policy network using Monte-Carlo sampling.

Using a discriminator network that is designed for discerning between super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images, the adversarial loss drives the solution of this architecture to natural images. Moreover, the content loss is driven by perceptual similarity rather than pixel space similarity.

This study proposes a novel combined model color correction (CMCC) method for high-resolution optical satellite images, which constructively combines a defogging model with a radiation correction model. First, this study analyzed the feasibility of using easily available low-resolution satellite images as external references to correct the color of high-resolution images and describes the selection criteria for external references. Second, considering the negative effects of atmosphere on the color and clarity of remote sensing images, we proposed an optical satellite image enhancement method, which is based on the content characteristics of remote sensing images and the dark channel prior defogging method. Finally, we designed a two-stage color correction process: 1) correcting the color of downsampled images via low-frequency modeling and replacement and 2) mapping the color of downsampled images to original images through local modeling and super-resolution color correction. Furthermore, this study proposes an indicator of quality considered mean absolute error (QCMAE) for quantitative evaluation of the color correction result. We selected 328 Gaofen-1 (GF-1) high-resolution images for the experiments.

In this paper, we focus on a single-image super-resolution (SISR) problem in remote sensing, where the objective is to generate a reconstructed satellite image of high quality (i.e., a high spatial resolution) from a satellite image of relatively low quality. This problem is motivated by the lack of high quality satellite images in many remote sensing applications (e.g., due to the cost of high resolution sensors, communication bandwidth constraints, and historic hardware limitations). Two important challenges exist in solving our problem: i) it is not a trivial task to reconstruct a satellite image of high quality that meets the human perceptual requirement from a single low quality image; ii) it is challenging to rigorously quantify the uncertainty of the results of an SISR scheme in the absence of ground truth data. To address the above challenges, we develop PQA-CNN, a perceptual quality-assured conventional neural network framework, to reconstruct a high quality satellite image from a low quality one by designing novel uncertainty-driven neural network architectures and integrating an uncertainty quantification model with the framework. We evaluate PQA-CNN on a real-world remote sensing application on land usage classifications.

However, we discover that most existing methods are biased to synthesize fake details or enhanced textures and fail to learn representations of object shape. They are often misguided to recover the shape of small objects and focus on generating less meaningful high-frequency components. This is problematic when super-resolving satellite imagery since it contains many relatively small and clustered objects in a broad area. In this letter, we propose a new perceptual-driven SR method that has a stronger preference toward shape information. We integrate the scale-space filtering with the discriminator to attenuate high-frequency components in its decision space. It effectively encourages our discriminator to concentrate on structural shape information in differentiating real and fake images.

Under these circumstances, there are some problems to be solved. One is the existence of low-resolution satellite images. To analyze the lower resolution of satellite images there are some technical issues such as reduction of noise, misclassification of object recognition. Therefore, high-resolution images are necessary. However, high-resolution satellite images are expensive, and its images may not be available in the past satellite images. Super-resolution which is introduced in image processing is a method to solve these problems. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods are effective, and there is a need for models that can perform super-resolution with higher accuracy. In this paper, we propose a method for super-resolving satellite images, based on the improved the RCAN (residual channel attention network) model with SRM (style-based recalibration module).

However, the observed images from satellite sensors often suffer from low-resolution (LR), making it difficult to meet the requirements for further analysis. Super-resolution (SR) aims to increase the image resolution while providing finer spatial details, which perfectly remedies the weakness of satellite images. Therefore, in this article, we propose an innovative mixed high-order attention network (MHAN) for remote sensing SR. It comprises two components: a feature extraction network for feature extraction, and a feature refinement network with high-order attention (HOA) mechanism for detail restoration. In the feature extraction network, we replace the elementwise addition with weighted channelwise concatenation in all skip connections, which greatly facilitates the information flow. In the feature refinement network, rather than exploring the first-order statistics (spatial or channel attention), we introduce the HOA module to restore the missing details. Finally, to fully exploit hierarchical features, we introduce the frequency-aware connection to bridge the feature extraction and feature refinement networks. Experiments on two widely used remote sensing image data sets demonstrate that our MHAN not only obtains better accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods but also shows the superiority in terms of running time and GPU cost.

However, in the real world, it is a common requirement to zoom the videos arbitrarily by rolling the mouse wheel. In this article, we propose a unified network for arbitrary scale SR (ASSR) of video satellite images. The proposed ASSR consists of two modules, i.e., feature learning module and arbitrary upscale module. The feature learning module accepts multiple low-resolution (LR) frames and extracts useful features of those frames by using many 3-D residual blocks. The arbitrary upscale module takes the extracted features as input and enhances the spatial resolution by subpixel convolution and bicubic-based adjustment. Different from existing video satellite image SR methods, ASSR can continuously zoom LR video satellite images with arbitrary integer and noninteger scale factors in a single model. Experiments have been conducted on real video satellite images acquired by Jilin-1 and OVS-1. Quantitative and qualitative results have demonstrated that ASSR has superior reconstruction performance compared with the state-of-the-art SR methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3038653","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB0505500,2018YFB0505503); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A1515011877); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:19lgzd10); Guangzhou Science and Technology Planning Project(grant numbers:202002030240); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41501368); Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai)(grant numbers:99147-42080011); 2018 Key Research Platforms and Research Projects of Ordinary Universities in Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018KQNCX360); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9277650","Arbitrary scale;deep learning;super-resolution (SR);video satellite","Satellites;Convolution;Feature extraction;Spatial resolution;Image reconstruction;Image edge detection;Training","image reconstruction;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);video signal processing","video satellite image SR methods;ASSR;LR video satellite images;noninteger scale factors;unified network;arbitrary scale super-resolution;specific SR model;scale factor;arbitrary scale SR;feature learning module;arbitrary upscale module;low-resolution frames","","6","","46","IEEE","2 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we build a novel satellite SR framework by decomposing a high-resolution image into three components, i.e., low-resolution (LR), artifact, and high-frequency information. Specifically, we propose an artifact removal network with a self-adaption difference convolution (SDC) to fully exploit the structure prior in the LR image and predict the artifact map. Considering that the artifact map and the high-frequency map share a similar pattern, we introduce the supervised structure correction (SSC) block that establishes a bridge between the high-frequency generation process and the artifact removal process.

Multitudes of solutions have been proposed in this arena, yet there is a significant need for much better and flawless outputs. In this chapter, we expound on a two-level solution-Edge Boxes and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the detection of targets in satellite imagery, Super resolution of the image using Dense-skip-connections. In the first level, the military objects are detected from the satellite image using Edge Boxes. In satellite imagery, the edge data of targets contains very prominent and concise attributes. The traditionally engineered features such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Hough transform and Gabor feature do not work well for huge datasets. However, the Edge Boxes technique generates contours around the target objects and discards the remaining. The output of this level is fed to the second level, wherein, the proposed targets undergo image super resolution. The presented deep learning model tends to inherently learn an end-to-end mapping between images of lower resolution and higher resolution. This level can be portrayed as one which takes a low-resolution input image and constructs an up-sampled high-resolution image as the output. Unlike traditional methods (sparse coding based method, bicubic method) that handle each component separately, this method aims to optimize all the layers at once. Furthermore, for assuaging the vanishing gradient problem that is common to very deep networks, Dense-skip-connections are employed. These enable the building of shorter paths directly within multiple layers. Though the proposed model has a light weighted structure, it exhibits state-of-the-art restoration quality.","2642-7354","978-1-7281-6324-6","10.1109/ICCCA49541.2020.9250864","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9250864","Super resolution of image;Dense-skipconnections;EdgeBoxes;Deep CNN;HOG;Gabor feature;Hough transform","Deep learning;Image resolution;Satellites;Image edge detection;Transforms;Convolutional neural networks;Military satellites","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image representation;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);military computing;object detection","satellite image;deep convolutional neural networks;defense sector;military objects;image super resolution;deep learning model;low-resolution input image;high-resolution image;sparse coding based method;deep networks;military targets detection;dense-skip-connections;edge boxes technique","","","","18","IEEE","10 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is difficult for a single satellite to obtain such images due to technical and cost constraints. Therefore, spatiotemporal image fusion based on deep learning has received extensive attention in recent years. This article proposes a multicooperative deep convolutional neural network (MCDNet) for spatiotemporal satellite image fusion. This method is a new multinetwork model in which multiple networks work together to reconstruct the predicted image. The multinetwork model consists of a super-resolution network, a difference reconstruction network, and a collaborative training network. First, the super-resolution network uses the combination of a novel multiscale mechanism and dilated convolutions to make full use of the spectral information of the coarse image and upgrade it to a transitional image that matches the fine image. The difference reconstruction network uses structural relevance to complete the reconstruction of the fine difference image. The collaborative training network extracts the hidden information from the fine image and uses the time relevance to restrict the training of the difference reconstruction network. Finally, the fine difference image and the known fine image are combined to complete the image fusion. The new compound loss function can help multinetwork models better complete cooperative training.

For the processing of satellite videos, the commonly employed deep-learning-based single-frame SR (SFSR) framework has limited performance without using complementary information between the video frames. On the other side, the multiframe SR (MFSR) can utilize temporal subpixel information to super-resolve the high-resolution (HR) imagery. However, although deeper and wider deep learning network provides powerful feature representations for SR methods, it has always been a challenge to accurately reconstruct the boundaries of ground objects in video satellite images. In this article, to address these issues, we propose an edge-guided video SR (EGVSR) framework for video satellite image SR, which couples the MFSR model and the edge-SFSR (E-SFSR) model in a unified network. The EGVSR framework is composed of an MFSR branch and an edge branch. The MFSR branch is used to extract the complementary features from the consecutive video frames. Concurrently, the edge branch acts as an SFSR model to translate the edge maps from the low-resolution modality to the HR one. At the final SR stage, the DBFM is built to focus on the promising inner representations of the features of the two branches and fuse them. Extensive experiments on video satellite imagery show that the proposed EGVSR method can achieve superior performance compared to the representative deep-learning-based SR methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3121303","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2102900); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41801263); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9579427","Deep learning;edge prior;super-resolution (SR);video satellite","Satellites;Image edge detection;Image reconstruction;Spatial resolution;Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Deep learning","deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image reconstruction;image representation;image resolution;remote sensing;video signal processing","image super-resolution;single-frame SR framework;multiframe SR;temporal subpixel information;high-resolution imagery;deep learning network;edge-guided video SR framework;MFSR branch;edge branch;video frames;SFSR;low-resolution modality;video satellite imagery;EGVSR;boundaries reconstruction;satellite videos processing","","","","67","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the training stage, we build two five-layer CNNs to deal with the problems of complicated correspondence and large spatial resolution gaps between MODIS and Landsat images. Specifically, we first learn a nonlinear mapping CNN between MODIS and low-spatial-resolution (LSR) Landsat images and then learn a super-resolution CNN between LSR Landsat and original Landsat images. In the prediction stage, instead of directly taking the outputs of CNNs as the fusion result, we design a fusion model consisting of high-pass modulation and a weighting strategy to make full use of the information in prior images. Specifically, we first map the input MODIS images to transitional images via the learned nonlinear mapping CNN and further improve the transitional images to LSR Landsat images via the fusion model; then, via the learned SR CNN, the LSR Landsat images are supersolved to transitional images, which are further improved to Landsat images via the fusion model. Compared with the previous learning-based fusion methods, mainly referring to the sparse-representation-based methods, our CNNs-based spatiotemporal method has the following advantages: 1) automatically extracting effective image features; 2) learning an end-to-end mapping between MODIS and LSR Landsat images; and 3) generating more favorable fusion results. To examine the performance of the proposed fusion method, we conduct experiments on two representative Landsat-MODIS datasets by comparing with the sparse-representation-based spatiotemporal fusion model. The quantitative evaluations on all possible prediction dates and the comparison of fusion results on one key date in both visual effect and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method can generate more accurate fusion results.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2797894","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41501377,61532009,91546117); Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China(grant numbers:BK20150906,15KJA520001); National Social and Scientific Fund Program(grant numbers:16ZDA047); HKRGC General Research Fund(grant numbers:14606315); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8291042","Convolutional neural network (CNN);nonlinear mapping (NLM);spatial resolution;temporal resolution","Remote sensing;Earth;Artificial satellites;Spatial resolution;MODIS;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Training","feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;geophysical image processing;image fusion;image representation;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing","Landsat-MODIS datasets;end-to-end mapping learning;automatic effective image feature extraction;MODIS images;massive remote sensing data;low-spatial-resolution Landsat images;accurate fusion results;spatiotemporal fusion model;representative Landsat-MODIS datasets;spatiotemporal method;sparse-representation-based methods;learned SR CNN;LSR Landsat images;learned nonlinear mapping CNN;transitional images;prior images;super-resolution CNN;spatial resolution gaps;spatiotemporal fusion method;deep convolutional neural networks;spatiotemporal satellite image fusion","","170","","35","IEEE","13 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most MISR techniques are currently based on the aggregation of samples from registered low resolution images. A promising research trend aimed at incorporating natural image priors in MISR consists in using data-driven neural networks. However, due to the unavailability of ground truth high resolution data, these networks cannot be trained on real satellite images. In this paper, we present a framework for training MISR algorithms from bursts of satellite images without requiring high resolution ground truth. This is achieved by adapting the recently proposed frame-to-frame framework to process bursts of satellite images. In addition we propose an architecture based on feature aggregation that allows to fuse a variable number of frames and is capable of handling degenerate samplings while also reducing noise. On synthetic datasets, the proposed self-supervision strategy attains results on par with those obtained with a supervised training. We applied our framework to real SkySat satellite image bursts leading to results that are more resolved and less noisy than the L1B product from Planet.","2160-7516","978-1-6654-4899-4","10.1109/CVPRW53098.2021.00123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9522764","","Training;Satellites;Planets;Superresolution;Neural networks;Computer architecture;Optical imaging","artificial satellites;geophysical equipment;geophysical image processing;image resolution;image sampling;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;remote sensing","self-supervised multiimage super-resolution;push-frame satellite images;optical satellites;push-frame images;MISR techniques;registered low resolution images;natural image priors;data-driven neural networks;ground truth high resolution data;MISR algorithms;high resolution ground truth;frame-to-frame framework;SkySat satellite image bursts","","7","","69","IEEE","1 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These methods focused on various types of convolutional neural network (CNN) structures, which were trained by simply minimizing a spectral loss between network outputs and the corresponding high-resolution (HR) multi-spectral (MS) target images. However, owing to different sensor characteristics and acquisition times, HR panchromatic (PAN) and low-resolution MS image pairs tend to have large pixel misalignments, especially for moving objects in the images. Conventional CNNs trained with only the spectral loss with these satellite image data sets often produce PS images of low visual quality including double-edge artifacts along strong edges and ghosting artifacts on moving objects. In this letter, we propose a novel loss function, called a spectral-spatial structure (S3) loss, based on the correlation maps between MS targets and PAN inputs. Our proposed S3 loss can be very effectively used for pan-sharpening with various types of CNN structures, resulting in significant visual improvements on PS images with suppressed artifacts.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2019.2934493","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning through the Basic Science Research Program(grant numbers:2017R1A2A2A05001476); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812763","Convolutional neural network (CNN);deep learning;pan colorization;pan-sharpening;satellite imagery;spectral-spatial structure;super-resolution (SR)","Training;Satellites;Correlation;Spatial resolution;Visualization;Convolutional neural networks","convolutional neural nets;geophysical image processing;image classification;image fusion;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing","spectral-spatial structure loss;MS targets;PAN inputs;CNN structures;PS images;deep-learning-based pan-sharpening methods;high-quality pan-sharpened satellite images;convolutional neural network structures;spectral loss;network outputs;multispectral target images;HR panchromatic;moving objects;satellite image data sets;double-edge artifacts;strong edges;ghosting artifacts;loss function","","11","","32","IEEE","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
