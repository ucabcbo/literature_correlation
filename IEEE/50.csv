However, mangroves are fragile ecosystems and are affected by human activities and climate change. Long-term monitoring on mangroves is of great significance. This paper selected Tongming Bay located in southern China coast as a study case because of its high variation of mangrove extent. Satellite remote sensing images from 1978 to 2018 were used for mangrove extent interpretation, and to obtain the distribution, changes, and main driving factors of changes in the Tongming Bay area in the past 40 years. The results showed that the area of mangrove extent in Tongming Bay continued to shrink from 1978 to 2013, and the area gradually increased after 2013. The main driving factor for the reduction of mangroves was the artificial aquaculture occupation of mangrove habitats, and mangrove area growth was mainly caused by artificial planting. The results of this study can provide references for local government on mangrove management and ecological restoration.","2153-7003","978-1-7281-6374-1","10.1109/IGARSS39084.2020.9324084","The National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0501403); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9324084","Mangroves;Tongming Bay;Satellite remote sensing;Image interpretation","Remote sensing;Forestry;Earth;Artificial satellites;Aquaculture;Satellites;Monitoring;Climate change","aquaculture;geophysical image processing;remote sensing;vegetation","multitemporal satellite remote sensing imagery;coastline protection;bay improvement;climate change;southern China coast;satellite remote sensing images;mangrove area growth;mangrove management;wetland diversity protection;water purification;AD 1978 to 2018;Tongming Bay;ecological restoration;artificial planting","","1","","10","IEEE","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While a classifier trained from a previous image (source domain) cannot be directly applied to the current image (target domain) because of changes in imaging conditions and dynamics of land surface spectral properties, domain transfer techniques have been introduced in recent years to remove the need for a complete retraining of the current image data. This approach is further developed in the present study, and a domain transfer algorithm named Temporal-Adaptive Support Vector Machine (TASVM) is proposed. The algorithm enables the adaptation of a classifier trained with the source-domain image to the classification of the target-domain image where class data have a different distribution. The adaptation process is allowed to be conducted at the classifier-level where the source classifiers can be transferred without re-accessing the source domain raw data. Experimental analysis showed that the proposed algorithm generated stable results, especially under the circumstances where satisfactory results were hard to achieve with traditional algorithms.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-4951-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8127428","Domain adaptation;knowledge transfer;support vector machines;multi-temporal imagery;remote sensing classification","Support vector machines;Remote sensing;Algorithm design and analysis;Australia;Standards;Linear programming;Optimization","geophysical image processing;image classification;remote sensing;support vector machines","adaptation process;classifier-level;source classifiers;source domain raw data;domain-transfer support vector machine;multitemporal remote sensing imagery classification;supervised classification techniques;previous image;target domain;land surface spectral properties;domain transfer techniques;current image data;domain transfer algorithm;Temporal-Adaptive Support Vector Machine;source-domain image;target-domain image;class data;imaging conditions;imaging dynamics;classifier adaptation;traditional algorithms","","7","","8","IEEE","4 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Within a number of vegetation indices (VIs) that were examined for their sensitivity to the rice flood disaster, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were identified as the optimal VIs for detecting rice flood disaster. Based on the two-date satellite images and multi-temporal analysis, a mapping method for monitoring the rice flood disaster at a regional scale were developed based on support vector machine (SVM) and maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). And the model that relies on SVM method significantly outperformed the MLC method, with the overall accuracy increased from 0.64 to 0.82.

On the other hands, combining various satellite images acquired on different dates is a promising approach to obtain a more accurate classified map compared to the map obtained by single-date satellite imagery. In this study, wetlands within a pilot sites, located in Newfoundland were first classified using each of the several available Landsat 8 data, captured in the three seasons of Spring, Summer, and Fall. By doing this, the separability of the wetland classes in each season was analyzed. Then, these multi-temporal data were integrated to obtain a more accurate map of wetlands.

The region was caused by strong wind and rainstorm on August 23, 2017. The validation results showed that the multi-temporal Sentinel-1 image data can effectively extract the sugarcane planted area before and after lodging with an accuracy of 87.83%. Compared with other vegetation indices (RVI/LSWI/NBR/EVI/DVI), NDVI was the most sensitive in response to sugarcane lodging. The validation accuracy of extracting farmland damage extent reached 71.64%, among them, the affected area of sugarcane reached 711.33 ha.

In this paper, combining with Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA), we proposed an end-to-end network (DCCA-Net) for scene change detection. DCCA-Net firstly utilizes a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract high-dimensional features of the input scene pairs. Then, the DCCA module is deployed to project the extracted features into a new feature space and maximize the correlation of the projected feature pairs. Finally, based on the transformed feature vectors, the semantic label of each scene image could be obtained by a softmax classifier. The binary scene changes could be obtained using a binary classifier based on the transformed features. The objective function of DCCA is integrated into the loss function of classification and binary change detection, so that they could be optimized simultaneously. We implemented the proposed network and performed experiments on a VHR remote sensing imagery dataset (Multi-temporal Scene - Wuhan, Mts-WH) for scene change detection. The experimental results have shown the effect of the DCCA-Net, and our method could outperform other conventional scene change detection methods and the baseline methods based on CNN.","","978-1-7281-4615-7","10.1109/Multi-Temp.2019.8866943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8866943","Scene Change Detection;Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis Network (DCCA-Net);Convolutional Neural Network (CNN);VHR Remote Sensing Imagery","Feature extraction;Correlation;Remote sensing;Mathematical model;Semantics;Training;Support vector machines","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;image classification;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;remote sensing","DCCA module;feature space;projected feature pairs;transformed feature vectors;scene image;binary scene changes;transformed features;classification;binary change detection;VHR remote sensing imagery dataset;conventional scene change detection;canonical correlation analysis network;multitemporal VHR imagery;semantic scene level;high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery analysis;end-to-end network;deep canonical correlation analysis network;DCCA-Net firstly utilizes;pretrained convolutional neural network;high-dimensional features;input scene pairs;multitemporal scene","","3","","6","IEEE","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the increasing availability of multi-temporal remote sensing images, numerous change detection algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, image transformation methods with feature extraction and mapping could effectively highlight the changed information and thus has a better change detection performance. However, the changes of multi-temporal images are usually complex, and the existing methods are not effective enough. In recent years, the deep network has shown its brilliant performance in many fields, including feature extraction and projection. Therefore, in this paper, based on the deep network and slow feature analysis (SFA) theory, we proposed a new change detection algorithm for multi-temporal remotes sensing images called deep SFA (DSFA). In the DSFA model, two symmetric deep networks are utilized for projecting the input data of bi-temporal imagery. Then, the SFA module is deployed to suppress the unchanged components and highlight the changed components of the transformed features. The change vector analysis pre-detection is employed to find unchanged pixels with high confidence as training samples. Finally, the change intensity is calculated with chi-square distance and the changes are determined by threshold algorithms. The experiments are performed on two real-world data sets and a public hyperspectral data set. The visual comparison and the quantitative evaluation have shown that DSFA could outperform the other state-of-the-art algorithms, including other SFA-based and deep learning methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2930682","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFA0605500); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601333,61822113,41801285,41871243); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2018CFA050); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFC1502505); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8824216","Change detection;deep network;remote sensing images;slow feature analysis (SFA)","Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Change detection algorithms;Detection algorithms;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Artificial neural networks;Training","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;geophysical signal processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing;unsupervised learning","unsupervised deep slow feature analysis;multitemporal remote sensing images;remote sensing technology;image transformation methods;multitemporal images;slow feature analysis theory;change detection algorithm;multitemporal remotes;deep SFA;symmetric deep networks;bi-temporal imagery;changed components;change vector analysis pre-detection;change intensity;deep learning methods","","157","","49","IEEE","4 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the first step, we extract the line structures from two corresponding images using the EDLines algorithm, and a line validation procedure is then implemented to remove meaningless and fragmented lines. In the second step, the detected lines are further divided into a set of line segments by a length threshold, and a new descriptor is computed to describe each line segment. After that, a coarse matching process is implemented to compute the projective transformation model.

Remote sensing detection with large detection areas and high time resolution has become a popular method in detecting forest fire. Therefore, we propose a new method of detecting forest fire based on Himawari-8 geostationary satellite data. The detection algorithm used is the GBDT(Gradient Boost Decision Tree) machine learning combined with multi-temporal information referred to as MT-GBDT algorithm. Considering the characteristics of Yunnan Province, the algorithm of this paper uses contextual algorithms to filter potential fire points. Then, combined with multi-temporal information, we processed the potential fire point by using the diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model. Finally, we used GBDT machine learning model to process the information obtained in the above steps. Result shows that the fire point information with high accuracy is obtained. The probability of false detection is 18%, and the probability of detection is 86%. Compared with the existing three methods, MT-GBDT algorithm successfully detects most forest fires, while other algorithms omit many forest fires, and the probability of detection is 40% to 50%.","","978-1-7281-9638-1","10.1109/MLBDBI51377.2020.00099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9360932","fire detecting;Remote sensing;Himawari 8;machine learning","Training;Machine learning algorithms;Forestry;Machine learning;Remote sensing;Geostationary satellites;Context modeling","atmospheric temperature;data assimilation;decision trees;fires;geophysical image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);radiative transfer;remote sensing;weather forecasting","multitemporal remote sensing fire detection;forest fire;sensing detection;detection areas;high time resolution;detection algorithm;multitemporal information;MT-GBDT algorithm;potential fire point;GBDT machine;fire point information;false detection","","","","15","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm for multi-temporal remote sensing image registration based on depth residual network. In feature extraction stage, multi-scale descriptors are generated from the advanced convolution information of the trained ResNet50 network layer to improve the quantity and quality of feature point extraction. In the registration stage of point set, the difference of feature is calculated by Bhattacharyya distance, and the mismatched point pairs are eliminated by Random Sampling Consistency Algorithms (RANSAC). Finally, the transformation model of the point set is calculated by using the coordinates of the matching point pairs to achieve accurate registration of multitemporal remote sensing images. The experiment uses image data obtained from Google Earth and Lansat 8 satellites and Baidu Map to test the proposed algorithm, and compares it with two feature-based algorithms (PSO-SIFT and CNN).

Changes in observation conditions lead to brightness distortions, some of which are compensated by atmospheric correction. Unfortunately, the distortions in the composition of the scene (scene distortions) cannot be compensated using atmospheric correction and require fusion methods to be applied. The existing superresolution methods for remote sensing data are based on the assumption that there are no scene distortions in the analyzed images. In this article, we propose an algorithm for combining Earth remote sensing data with an increase in the spectral and spatial resolution taking into account scene distortions. We found that the use of a larger dataset including images with scene distortions reduces root mean square error of 2-4% on average if the dataset contains a small number of images without scene distortions (from 2 to 6). With the larger number of images without scene distortions, the error value decreases by 1%. If all the images in the input dataset contain scene distortions, the proposed algorithm achieves super-resolution restoration of the scene image as well.","","978-1-7281-7041-1","10.1109/ITNT49337.2020.9253307","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9253307","remote sensing images;super-resolution;scene distortions","Earth;Superresolution;Brightness;Distortion;Sensors;Spatial resolution;Remote sensing","geophysical image processing;image reconstruction;image registration;image resolution;image restoration;mean square error methods;remote sensing","brightness distortions;atmospheric correction;Earth remote sensing data;scene image;remote sensing image;partial scene distortions;super-resolution reconstruction;multitemporal images;spectral resolution;spatial resolution;root mean square error","","","","13","IEEE","12 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a key issue to use multitemporal remote sensing data effectively and flexibly. With the development of remote sensing and computer science, state-of the-art research on crop yield estimation has shifted from relying on a single static state to a combination of multiple spectral and time-series information. We propose a method to divide multispectral data into a single time phase in deep learning and then combine the information of the multitemporal results on each neural network model. This can maintain the accuracy of the original information although the remote sensing multi-time series data is missing in some time phases. However, in actual practice, more accurate results can be further obtained with the superposition of new time-series data. We trained several semantic segmentation models for each individual time-series dataset. On the single time phase model, the accuracy of rice classification, corn classification and forest classification were 85.9%-92.8%, 77%-93% and 77%-87.6% respectively. Furthermore, the classification accuracy of our method for all catalogs reached 92.6% by the multi-temporal verification dataset from May to September of 2017.

In this paper, we firstly explore one source and multiple target domains issue for remote sensing application and build a challenging mixed multi-target dataset to contribute to the community. Our method constitutes three parts. Firstly, as we are blind for the multitarget domain, we adopt meta learning to divide the mixed multi-target dataset and insert sub-target domain loss as the part of the loss function. Secondly, we apply the adversarial learning to confuse the classifier to discriminate between the source domain images and the whole mixed multi-target domain images. Finally, the meta learning and the adversarial learning are dynamically iterative procedures and the labels for domain classification in mixed multi-target dataset will be updated for a particular iteration.

The change area in the initial differential image has local consistency and global prominence. By detecting the significant area to locate similar change areas, the coherent speckle noise outside the area can be eliminated. The use of hierarchical FCM clustering to automatically generate training samples can improve the reliability of training samples. In addition, in order to increase the distinction between the changed area and the non-changed area, a sparse automatic encoder is used to extract the changed features and generate a change detection map. Experiments using 4 sets of SAR images show that the algorithm can effectively reduce the effect of speckle noise on detection accuracy, the extraction of changing areas is more complete and meticulous, and the false detection rate is greatly reduced. Since the images in different time phases will be disturbed by weather, clouds, sea water, etc., the target segmentation algorithm can be used to extract the target of interest and highlight the changing area. Principal component analysis and k-means clustering method are used to reduce the influence of isolated pixels, and change information is extracted to obtain different images. The experiment uses four sets of image data of islands and reefs. The experiment proves that the algorithm can well eliminate external interference, improve the accuracy of change detection, and have a good detection effect on the area of islands and reefs.

Recently, deep learning techniques has become the fastest-growing trend in remote sensing data classification including vegetation mapping data. To overcome the challenge of learning deep models and for easily multi-temporal vegetation mapping and monitoring, in this paper, we propose a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit Network (BGRU) model, which is based on history information and able to deal with long-term sequential data using only few parameters to extract useful features using forward and backward gates for their automatically classification.

Remote sensing technology can obtain surface data for long time series, which has important advantages in wetland structural change and ecological health assessment. In this paper, the characteristics of wetland structure of Wuliangsuhai in the past 40 years from 1977 to 2015 were studied by using multi-temporal LandSAT data. The driving factors of wetland structure change were analyzed. The ecological health of Wuliangsuhai wetland was evaluated based on the pressure-state-response (PSR) model. The results showed that: (1) In 1997, the wetland structure was dominated by the water, and the water area was 61.70% of the whole wetland area. With the decrease of the water area and the increase of the reed area, the reed and water became the main types of wetland structure during the period from 1998 to 2006. The total area of wetland was 50% higher than that of wetland in 2015, and the structure of wetland was changed from water to reed in 1977. (2) The ecological health status of Wuliangsuhai wetland was in an alert state from 1977 to 1996. The ecological function level of the Wuliangsuhai wetland was degraded, but the ecological system could be maintained. The ecological health status of the Wuliangsuhai Wetland in 2006 and 2015 changed from the original alert state to a good state, but the comprehensive evaluation index was in the lower limit of the good condition, which indicated that the ecological health status of the Wuliangsuhai wetland had improved, the external pressure was decreased but not obvious.

Backscatter coefficient data was used as well. The result was verified using GF-1 optical image. An accuracy of 82.44% was achieved if we consider the result from GF-1 optical image as `ground true'.

It also protects Ganges Delta's people from water surges, and cyclones. The land cover of Sundarban is degraded day by day which is threaten for mangrove plants, and animals. To detect those changes for forest mapping, feature characterization and mapping of coastal erosion, remote sensing (RS) imagery have adopted based on Satellite e.g., Landsat images. The conventional change detection (CD) approaches include post-classification comparison (PCC), unsupervised CD, change vector analysis (CVA), single threshold algorithm (STA) etc. However, the single RS image classification result may not be satisfactory using the PCC method. Tiny noise and changes of land-use or land-cover heritage cannot be recognized apparently through unsupervised CD method. CVA losses information when it uses original feature space whereas STA possesses certain difficulties to compute the complete information. Consequently, this paper proposed a CD technique to quantify the temporary changes of Sundarban RS images from 2011 to 2019 based on NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) for making an index of Floras for indicating the volume/amount of which area is highly vegetated and whether growing of vegetation is possible or not. The outcome of this experiment indicates progressive changes for high-vegetation (0.02%), vegetation (19.22%), regressive changes for water (17.30%), and no-vegetation (1.93%).","","978-1-7281-6040-5","10.1109/EICT48899.2019.9068819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9068819","Remote Sensing;Landsat Imagery;Multi-temporal Images;Sundarban;Change Detection;NDVI","Remote sensing;Vegetation mapping;Earth;Forestry;Artificial satellites;Satellites;Sea measurements","ecology;erosion;geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;remote sensing;terrain mapping;vegetation;vegetation mapping","STA;CD technique;temporary changes;Sundarban RS images;progressive changes;regressive changes;Sundarban mangrove forest;remote sensing data;global ecosystem;environmental impurities;Ganges Delta's people;water surges;mangrove plants;forest mapping;remote sensing imagery;Landsat images;conventional change detection;post-classification comparison;single threshold algorithm;single RS image classification result;PCC method;land-use;land-cover heritage;unsupervised CD method;CO2","","7","","28","IEEE","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, based on the sequential network, namely convolution LSTM, we built an end-to-end ship change detection (SCD) R-CNN network. The network extracts abstract semantic information reflecting the changed features of ships, and the time correlation between features of the different phases is established. Specifically, the changed features are utilized to guide the judgement of ship change.

The landslide shows spatially and temporally varying displacement rates with up to 12 cm/a and a mean annual displacement of 4 cm/a. The results show that only the ATTS provides sufficient temporal resolution and spatial accuracy for assessing the temporal behaviour of the landslide's movement. However, ATTS measurements are only available at the installed 53 retro-reflecting prisms. Multi-temporal TLS can provide additional insight into the spatial displacement pattern at various man-made and natural objects such as walls, fences, poles and tree stems. But the respective accuracy and data acquisition intervals do not allow to draw conclusions about the temporal dynamics of the landslide's movement.

Crop rotation planting of green manure could increase soil fertility, improve soil micro-ecological environment, and is conducive to the enhancement of farmland productivity, which is of great significance for protecting farmland ecological environment and promoting agricultural sustainable development. Compared with the traditional means of ground survey and statistics method, remote sensing technology has the characteristics of macroscopic and real-time, which could quickly obtain the distribution of regional scale Astragalus sinicus planting. How to establish distinguishable remote sensing features is the basis of its recognition and extraction. In this study, multi-temporal Sentinel 2 images covering the main growing period of the Astragalus sinicus from December 2019 to June 2020 were selected as data source. The variation of spectral characteristics of Astragalus sinicus were studied in the typical pilot area of green manure crop rotation in Liuhe District, Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province. On this basis, the multi-temporal vegetation index data set was constructed. The recursive feature elimination and random forest algorithm were used to analyze the influence of feature composition on recognition accuracy, and then the effective recognition feature set of Astragalus sinicus at different time phases was established. Through this study, we explored the recognition ability of multi-temporal Sentinel 2 images for Astragalus sinicus, and provided a theoretical basis for the study of regional-scale Astragalus sinicus remote sensing monitoring.","","978-1-7281-6561-5","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics50104.2021.9530363","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530363","Astragalus sinicus;Sentinel-2;multi-temporal remote sensing images;feature selection;Random Forest","Image recognition;Green products;Urban areas;Crops;Vegetation mapping;Soil;Feature extraction","agriculture;crops;ecology;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;remote sensing;soil;statistical analysis;sustainable development;vegetation;vegetation mapping","regional-scale Astragalus sinicus;remote sensing feature selection;green manure crop Astragalus sinicus;multitemporal Sentinel-2 imagery;main planting;crop rotation planting;soil microecological environment;farmland ecological environment;promoting agricultural sustainable development;remote sensing technology;regional scale Astragalus sinicus;distinguishable remote sensing features;multitemporal Sentinel 2 images;green manure crop rotation;multitemporal vegetation index data;effective recognition feature","","1","","21","IEEE","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a first step, we trained our CNN model on images at a single time step for multi-label classification, i.e. mono-temporal. We incorporated time-series images using a LSTM model to assess whether or not multi-temporal signals from satellites improves CLC classification. The results demonstrate an improvement of approximately 0.89% in classifying satellite imagery on 15 classes using a multi-temporal approach on monthly time series images compared to the mono-temporal approach.

In this paper, a novel interference mitigation method based on multi-temporal coupling analysis is proposed. The temporal-spatial coupling between time-series images could be modeled as low rank, while the interference follows the sparsity constraints due to the time-varying property.

In this paper, we present an evidential fusion framework of manifold alignment to combine more than two multi-temporal remote sensing images. Embedding of multi-groups two temporal images pairs after MA can be intergraded based a layered structure of D-S theory. The proposed method was evaluated using five Landsat 8 images. Results confirmed that the proposed algorithm performed better than those with only two temporal images.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-4951-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8127078","Manifold alignment;Domain adaptation;Evidence theory;Multi-temporal classification","Manganese;Hafnium","geophysical image processing;image classification;image fusion;land cover;terrain mapping","multitemporal images classification;manifold alignment;multitemporal remote sensing images classification;long-term environmental monitoring;land cover change detection;remote-sensing images classification;temporal images;classification effect;evidential fusion framework;Landsat 8 images;multitemporal data;distinctive information","","","","4","IEEE","4 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a two-layer slow feature analysis network (SFANet) is proposed to realize effective change detection with multiple temporal remote sensing images. The proposed method extends the existing slow feature analysis method to a two-layer network structure and forms a slow feature analysis network. On the basis of multi-temporal feature extraction in slow feature analysis network, change detection is realized by threshold method.

To this extent, ground-based non-destructive testing (NDT) methods have been successfully applied for decades, reaching very high standards of data quality and accuracy. However, routine and systematic campaigns are required over relatively long inspection times for data collection and implementation into reliable infrastructure management systems (IMSs). On the other hand, satellite remote sensing techniques, such as the Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) method, have proven effective in monitoring ground displacements of transport infrastructures (roads, railways and airfields), with a much higher temporal frequency of investigation and wider inspection catchment areas. Nevertheless, the integration of information from i) satellite remote sensing and ii) ground-based NDT methods is still a subject to be explored in civil engineering. Within this framework, this paper aims to review significant stand-alone applications in these two areas of technology for transport infrastructure monitoring. Furthermore, recent advances, main challenges and future perspectives arising from their integration are discussed.

The method is based on the computation of a “super-image”, with a large number of looks, by temporal averaging. Then, ratio images are formed by dividing each image of the multi-temporal stack by the “super-image”. In the absence of changes of the radiometry, the temporal fluctuations of the intensity at a given spatial location are due to the speckle phenomenon. In areas affected by temporal changes, fluctuations cannot be ascribed to speckle only but also to radiometric changes. The overall effect of the division by the “super-image” is the spatial stationarity improvement: ratio images are much more homogeneous than the original images. Therefore, filtering these ratio images with a speckle-reduction method is more effective, in terms of speckle suppression, than filtering the original multitemporal stack. After denoising of the ratio image, the despeckled multi-temporal stack is obtained by multiplication with the “super-image”. Results are presented and analyzed both on synthetic and real SAR data and show the interest of the proposed approach.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-7150-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8519161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519161","Multi-temporal SAR series;ratio image;super-image;SAR;despeckling","Synthetic aperture radar;Speckle;Noise reduction;Time series analysis;Radiometry;Noise measurement;Buildings","geophysical image processing;image denoising;radar imaging;radiometry;remote sensing by radar;speckle;synthetic aperture radar","fast ratio based multitemporal SAR;SAR images;temporal averaging;ratio image;super-image;temporal fluctuations;temporal changes;original images;speckle-reduction method;despeckled multitemporal stack","","5","","7","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The cameras are designed to gather remotely sensed images, which are used to sense things of the earth's surface. Like the cameras on the satellites and the airplanes takes pictures of the different area, allowing us to get every minute detail about it. Now, change detection is the process to identify the changes or differences in various parts of land characteristics at different intervals. This process can be carried by manual observation or by the use of remote sensing software. Because of the rapid urbanization there has been a significant impact on resources and urban environment. But with the use of high quality multi-spatial and multi-temporal remote sensing data, it is quite easy to possibly observe the changes in the urban environment. Therefore, the given study aims to quantify changes in the urban area of Symbiosis University Nagpur, Maharashtra India using Land satellite image.

Firstly, time series displacements in the azimuth and LOS direction can be estimated using traditional methods of SAR interferometry (InSAR) and SAR pixel offset tracking. Then, a fitting and interpolation procedure was applied to parameterize the displacement history and interpolate the displacements from different datasets with identical dates.

And the detected craters serve as important research objects during the whole aerospace engineering process like landing and navigation of rovers. The large scale craters detection have been extensively studied. However, with the development of high resolution sensors of Moon and Mars, methods specified on extracting smaller craters from high resolution image (HRI) are needed. But dealing with HRI is tricky because: (1) small ground targets can be varied largely in images of different illuminations; (2) A small crater's shape could easily erode over time to blend into the surface; (3) The number of the small craters are much larger than that of the large carters.

Because Japan has so many dikes to survey, an efficient surveying approach is needed. This paper presents the results and accuracy of dike elevation estimation using multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. First, the displacement along the radar line-of-sight direction was calculated by applying persistent-scatterer interferometry to SAR images observed on ascending and descending orbits. The least-squares method was then applied to those results, and the east-west and vertical displacement velocities were estimated by assuming that no north-south displacement occurred. Finally, the displacement velocity was multiplied by a chosen time period, and the elevation at the end of that time period was obtained by adding the known initial elevation. The experimental results show that the root-mean-square error of the elevation of the dike crown was 5.3 cm whereas that of the dike slope exceeded 25 cm. It is concluded that the presented approach is effective for monitoring the dike crown, and the accuracy of the elevation of the dike slope is expected to improve.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8898110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8898110","Synthetic aperture radar (SAR);dike displacement monitoring;multi-temporal SAR image analysis;PSInSAR","Levee;Laser radar;Synthetic aperture radar;Two dimensional displays;Radar polarimetry;Rivers;Orbits","radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","dike slope;dike crown;multitemporal SAR images;efficient dike management;Japan;dikes;efficient surveying approach;dike elevation estimation;multitemporal synthetic aperture radar images;radar line-of-sight direction;persistent-scatterer interferometry;ascending descending orbits;least-squares method;east-west displacement velocities;vertical displacement velocities;displacement velocity;chosen time period;known initial elevation;root-mean-square error;size 200.0 m;size 5.3 cm;size 25.0 cm","","","","7","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study high accuracy of estimating subsidence on the river dikes is demonstrated, which has not been reported in those previous studies. Low backscatter and high temporal decorrelation on the grasses covering the surface of the river dike makes the estimation from SAR difficult. L-band monitoring from ALOS PALSAR data is expected to be more capable to estimate deformation of the river dike since the L-band microwave observation is robust against the grasses on the dike and against high temporal decorrelation. However intensity and coherence of backscatter signals from the river dike is very low and insufficient for accurate estimation on time-series interferometry analysis even with the L-band imagery. I developed a time-series interferometry algorithm based on L-band ALOS/PALSAR imagery and tested it on river dike subsidence estimation. Since the estimated parameter set in each pixel is not sufficiently accurate and has high variance the output parameter is calculated by averaging the values on several pixels. The result in this paper demonstrates the accuracy of the evaluated error is within almost 5mm/year, which should satisfy requirements of practical use for monitoring.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-3332-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7730560","multi-temporal interferometry;SAR;river dike;subsidence monitoring","Levee;Rivers;Monitoring;Estimation;Backscatter;L-band;Interferometry","environmental monitoring (geophysics);radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;rivers;synthetic aperture radar;time series","river dike subcidence estimation;satellite-borne multitemporal SAR interferometry;deformation monitoring;L-band monitoring;ALOS PALSAR data;river dike deformation estimation;L-band microwave observation;time series interferometry analysis;L-band imagery;L-band ALOS-PALSAR imagery","","","","11","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study presents a novel approach for transport assets monitoring, based on the synergistic use of medium resolution (C-Band) and high resolution (X-Band) SAR imagery. To this effect, a multi-temporal SAR Interferometry analysis of high and medium-resolution datasets is performed on a runway of the Leonardo Da Vinci Airport in Rome, Italy. The data were acquired by the Scntinel-l A and the COSMO-SkyMed missions, respectively. A comparison between the results from medium and high-resolution datasets demonstrates the viability of using multi-frequency SAR imagery, and pave the way to the development of new methodologies for the monitoring of transport infrastructures.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9553749","Remote Sensing;COSMO-SkyMed;Persistent Scatterers Interferometry;Non-Destructive Assessment;Transport Infrastructure Monitoring;InSAR;C-Band Sentinel 1;Satellite Remote Sensing","Image resolution;C-band;Space missions;Radar polarimetry;Synthetic aperture radar interferometry;Monitoring;Synthetic aperture radar","image resolution;radar imaging;radar interferometry;radar resolution;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;time series","transport assets monitoring;medium-resolution datasets;COSMO-SkyMed missions;high-resolution datasets;multifrequency SAR imagery;transport infrastructures;cosmo-skymed multitemporal SAR Interferometry;synthetic aperture radar interferometry;fast network-level surveys;multitemporal data acquisitions;medium ground resolution;C-band imagery;transport infrastructure monitoring;accurate information;medium resolution SAR data;nondestructive surveying methodologies;sentinel-1 multitemporal SAR Interferometry;InSAR;network-level surveys;time series;medium resolution SAR imager;high resolution SAR imager;Leonardo Da Vinci Airport;Rome;Italy","","7","","33","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the trade-off between temporal resolution and spatial resolution and/or the influence of cloud covering, make it difficult to obtain fine-scale spatial-temporal relationship analysis. To relieve these difficulties, this study employs multi-temporal and multi-sensor fusion methods for summer spatial-temporal relationships of Land surface temperature (LST) with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation fraction (VF) and impervious surface fraction (ISF) analysis on Wuhan city of China. Here, the correlation analysis was extended from two-dimensional to three-dimensional by using the continuous fused data (from 1988 to 2013). Our analysis indicates there is a strong negative relationship between LST and NDVI as well as VF, whereas the relationship between LST and ISF is obvious positive correlation. In addition, we also find that all these relationships are spatial-temporal steady. This result suggest that increasing impervious surface area means enhance LST, whereas increasing vegetation means weaken LST in summer, especially in the “warm edge” area. We believe the use of continuous long-term data weakened the interference of data quality and improve the reliability.","2334-0932","978-1-4799-6652-3","10.1109/JURSE.2015.7120459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7120459","","Land surface temperature;Remote sensing;Earth;Satellites;Land surface;Vegetation mapping;Thermal pollution","atmospheric temperature;geophysical image processing;image fusion;land surface temperature;thermal pollution;vegetation;vegetation mapping","land surface temperature;vegetation indicators;impervious surface fraction;multitemporal remotely sensed data;multisensor remotely sensed data;LST distribution;surface urban heat island;SUHI analysis;fine-scale spatial-temporal relationship analysis;normalized difference vegetation index;multitemporal fusion method;multisensor fusion method;continuous fused data;AD 1988 to 2013;warm edge area;data quality","","3","","13","IEEE","11 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multi-temporal airborne lidar data has been recently used to accurately predict change in forest attributes such as aboveground biomass (AGB). In this study, we assessed the ability of multi-temporal airborne lidar (2008 and 2016) and single-date inventory data to estimate forest biomass dynamics. To do so, we compared different imputation approaches to predict biomass, specifically direct (i.e., a model trained by the biomass variable or AGB) and indirect (i.e., a model trained by structure variables - basal area, tree volume and stem density) approaches. We also evaluated the ability of the selected model in temporally estimating biomass by relating biomass predictions with forest disturbance data. Our results demonstrated that AGB can be better predicted using an indirect imputation method in which lidar metrics were trained by a structure variable (basal area, RMSE = 95.09, R2 = 0.89). While the model was developed for the date of inventory measurements (2016), the model was successfully applied to predict biomass for a historical date (2008). For both years, biomass predictions were highly consistent with disturbance history. This study further informs the benefits of multi-temporal lidar data to estimate forest biomass dynamics in instances when only single-date inventory data are available. The work thus can support forest researchers and managers in improving their scientific and practical tasks in forest management.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8897905","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8897905","Lidar;single-date inventory;biomass","Biomass;Forestry;Laser radar;Biological system modeling;Predictive models;Remote sensing;Atmospheric modeling","forestry;optical radar;remote sensing by laser beam;vegetation;vegetation mapping","single-date inventory data;multitemporal airborne lidar data;forest attributes;aboveground biomass;biomass variable;structure variable;biomass predictions;forest disturbance data;multitemporal lidar data;forest biomass dynamics;disturbance history","","1","","18","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it is important to get an accurate estimation of rice acreage for both food pro-duction and climate change related studies. This study aims to quickly and accurately map the rice planting area using GF-6 WFV time-series images in Hongze District, Jiangsu Province of China. Field campaigns were carried out during the rice growing season and ground-truth data were collected for classification accuracy assessments in 2019. The land cover types were classified as rice, natural vegetation, water bodies, economic crops and other nonvegetated areas. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), and Normalized Differ-ence Red Edge 1 Index (NDRE1) were established by the GF-6 WFV images taken in several key growth stages of rice. As such, a remote sensing extraction of rice was established, according to the dynamic change of NDVI, NDWI, RVI, and NDREI of var-ious feature types over time. A stepwise classification strategy utilizing the VIs signatures during key growth stages of rice was proposed. After the accuracy verification by visual interpretation points using RapidEye high-resolution image, the overall classification accuracy was calculated. Results showed that the extraction area of rice was 332.35 km2 in the study area, and the overall classification accuracy was 92.43 %. At the same time, the distribution map of rice without red edge bands was ob-tained using the same remote sensing images and masks, substi-tuting NDVI for NDREI in the preliminary rice extraction. More importantly, the extraction with red edge bands showed increases of 0.50%, 4.71 %, 5.93% and 0.05 in the overall accu-racy, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy of rice, and kappa coefficient, respectively. By contrast, the extraction with or without red edge bands was superimposed on the remote sensing image, indicating that the rice distributions were similar, but the extraction without red edge bands presented an obvious omission. This finding proved that the red edge bands effectively re-duced the classification error and omission of crops. Conse-quently, the domestic red edge satellite data can provide a great application potential to crop classification and area extraction.","","978-1-6654-7078-0","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics55649.2022.9859012","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20200281); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9859012","rice;fields mapping;GF-6 images;spectral index;red edge band","Methane;Visualization;Satellites;Greenhouse effect;Image edge detection;Crops;Vegetation mapping;Climate change","crops;geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;remote sensing;terrain mapping;vegetation;vegetation mapping","rice fields mapping;MultiTemporal GF-6 Remote Sensing;rice field;rice acreage;rice planting area;GF-6 WFV time-series images;Normalized Difference Vegetation Index;Normalized Differ-ence Red Edge 1 Index;GF-6 WFV images;classification accuracy;red edge bands;preliminary rice extraction;rice distributions","","","","9","IEEE","23 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A semi-empirical model was used to model C- and L-band backscatter as function of total aboveground, stem and branch biomass; a linear regression model was used for P-band. Calibrated with the aid of inventory plots, the models were used to estimate total aboveground, stem, and branch biomass for each individual scene in the multi-temporal and multi-frequency stack of observations. Individual estimates were then combined using weights reflecting each scenes' sensitivity to the biomass component in question. At the plot scale, the retrieval errors were 37, 40, and 33 % for total aboveground, stem, and branch biomass in terms of the relative RMSE; the error further reduced to 33, 38, and 27 % when calibrating models per species. We find that i) the retrieval of total aboveground, stem and branch biomass benefits from the availability of multi-temporal/-frequency data as the lowest retrieval errors with the best single image (P-band) were about 6 to 8 % higher, ii) there is no benefit in estimating total aboveground biomass via independent estimates of stem and branch biomass, iii) consideration of species specific differences associated with different allocations of biomass to stems and branches allows for improving the retrieval.","","978-1-5386-3327-4","10.1109/Multi-Temp.2017.8035231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8035231","aboveground biomass;SAR;multi-frequency;multi-temporal","Biomass;Biological system modeling;Backscatter;Synthetic aperture radar;L-band;Frequency estimation","remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","multitemporal SAR data;Sweden;semiempirical model;L-band backscatter;inventory plots;total aboveground;multi-frequency stack;retrieval errors;branch biomass;calibrating models","","1","","5","IEEE","14 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To handle this problem, a new kind of organizing and indexing method for multiple remote sensing data, consisting of the multi-scale grid integer coding (MGIC) in 2D-space and the multi-scale time segment integer coding (MTISIC), was proposed to index temporal and spatial information of multiple remote sensing data, which would be much conducive to manage multi-source, multi-scale and multi-temporal massive geo-spatial data and to develop a global, standardized, hierarchical, and shared organization model.","","978-1-5386-1437-2","10.1109/BGDDS.2018.8626834","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8626834","management of remote sensing data;index;multi-scale;integer coding","Indexes;Fans","geographic information systems;remote sensing;visual databases","temporal and spatial information;shared organization model;remote sensing platforms;global massive remote sensing data;geo-spatial data;multiscale time segment integer coding;multiscale grid integer coding;multiple remote sensing data;indexing method","","","","10","IEEE","27 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The still ongoing displacement of the areas, especially the underground frozen soil wall installed, should be quantitatively estimated. In usual, the displacement estimated by persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI)[1,2] is obtained only in the radar line-of-sight (LOS) direction. We estimated three-dimensional displacement velocities by applying the least-squares method to the results from PSI and Global Positioning System (GPS) data. We used 13 and 17 ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 images acquired on the ascending and descending orbits, respectively in addition to the displacement data measured at 10 GPS stations. The obtained results show that local displacement is estimated, and the displacement along the frozen soil wall is different from the neighboring areas.

We employed a Multi-temporal InSAR (MTI) method based on the PS and SBAS method proposed by Hopper to estimate height of urban building and ground deformation simultaneously. By means of MTI method, the first raw urban DSM with 1,500 km2 areas over urban area has been mapped with a height accuracy of about 5 m. The MTI-derived deformation shows that the established TerraSAR DSM reduced the height error influence on deformation phase effectively.

The proposed method relies on the adaptive selection and exploitation, pixel-by-pixel, of the medium-to-high coherent interferograms, such as to discard the noisy phase measurements. In such a way, for each pixel, it is possible to obtain several disjoined sets of interferograms, which are then connected by exploiting the weighted singular value decomposition (WSVD) method.

Therefore, timely and accurate classification and monitoring on paddy rice are necessary for scientific and practical purposes. Precise paddy rice field maps require high spatial resolution and temporal observation frequency. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images at 500-m or 250-m spatial resolution have problems with coarse spatial resolution and mixed land cover types within a pixel. When generating annual cropping maps at large scales using multi-temporal and high spatial resolution (e.g. Landsat TM/ETM+), the problems with low temporal resolution and missing pixels(e.g. cloud cover and SLC-off data) reduce the amount of usable data. In the past, the accuracy and efficiency for paddy rice classification and mapping at fine spatial resolutions were limited by the poor data availability and traditional classification methods. Thanks to the strong ability of deep learning(DL) in feature representation, DL has been introduced into environmental remote sensing and applied in many aspects, including land cover mapping. This study aims to use a semantic segmentation model for large scale paddy rice classification based on multi-temporal Landsat data. To address the challenge of Landsat data due to low temporal resolution and inevitable cloud contamination, this research uses linear interpolation and temporal resampling to largely overcome the cloud contamination issue. The experiment was carried out in Arkansas located in the middle and lower reaches of the Mississippi River, with an area of 137,733 km2, which is the largest rice producing state in the U.S. Experiments were designed to evaluate what information is most useful for training the deep learning model for paddy rice classification, and how various temporal intervals (7-day, 14-day and 28-day) affect the paddy rice classification performance in order to derive optimal time interval. All experiments were conducted over Arkansas’ agricultural planting areas, and a total of 63 Landsat multitemporal scenes including all the six optical spectral bands spanning from 2016 to 2019 were used to train and test. To assess the performance of the trained model, we calculated pixel-based metrics and analysed the results by using overall accuracy (OA) and F1 score. Computational experiments show temporal resampling leads to improved classification accuracies when compared to non-resample. A good performance of the proposed model was also recorded when temporal interval was 7-day and 14-day. Compared with 6 optical spectral bands as training features, 3 bands (red, near-infrared and short-wave infrared) show notably better performance and have overall accuracy of 0.77-0.91, with the F1 score of 0.65-0.91. Overall, our results demonstrate the valuable potential of the semantic segmentation model that utilizes multi-temporal data from Landsat which allows for detailed classification and mapping of paddy rice field over large areas.","","978-1-7281-6561-5","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics50104.2021.9530360","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530360","paddy rice;classification;multi-temporal;semantic segmentation","Earth;Climate change;Artificial satellites;Clouds;Semantics;Data models;Optical sensors","agriculture;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);geophysical image processing;image classification;image segmentation;interpolation;land cover;remote sensing;terrain mapping","multitemporal Landsat data;deep semantic segmentation model;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer;cloud cover;SLC-off data;land cover mapping;cloud contamination;deep learning;Landsat multitemporal scenes;paddy rice classification;annual cropping maps;paddy rice field maps;food security;water use;climate change;disease transmission;MODIS images;environmental remote sensing;Arkansas;Mississippi River;U.S.;AD 2016 to 2019;linear interpolation","","1","","35","IEEE","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This, in turn, would have an adverse effect on the correctness of actual change detection. This paper's aim is to propose a methodology about the recognition of change technique that is expected to curtail the influence exerted by improper alignment of images. And to effect this, the method of detecting alternations or changes based on pixel is being advanced, as this suggested method would deal with errors arising out of mis-registration effectively. The technique proposed here involves image stitching by combining two or more images of the same scene as a single larger image. Block matching technique is a way of locating matching blocks in a sequence of image for the purpose of image estimation. To spot the alteration in image, the use of image differencing is being advocated.

So far, most of the decision fusion techniques developed for the remote sensing applications have the drawback of assuming conditional independence between the classification results and integrates only two sensor data. The proposed Multi-sensor Fusion of Correlated Probabilities (MFCP) algorithm is rooted in the Baye's theorem and is the extended version of the Fusion of Correlated Probabilities (FCP) method by accounting for the cross conditional dependence between three multi-sensor information sources. At first, this dependence (or correlation) structure is efficiently formulated from the binary classification results of SVM by considering three sensor data and then finally used as weighting parameters in the proposed novel MFCP based fusion method. The proposed MFCP based fusion method is assessed in the multi-sensor land cover classification over the Beijing area. The data sets used consisted of two optical data sets (i.e., Landsat TM and CBERS) and one multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data set. We evaluated and validated our proposed methodology by comparing it with four existing fusion methods, i.e., Max rule based decision fusion method, Consensus theory based decision fusion method, SVM based decision fusion method and Tau model based decision fusion method. To further validate the effectiveness of the proposed MFCP based fusion method, we performed a significance test for kappa's between different fusion results. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed MFCP based fusion method outperformed all the compared fusion methods that do not take into account the cross conditional dependence between classifications, in terms of overall accuracy, kappa and class wise accuracies.","","978-1-5090-1479-8","10.1109/EORSA.2016.7552784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7552784","Decision fusion;Cross conditional dependence;Multi-sensor Fusion of Correlated Probabilities;significance test for kappa","Correlation;Remote sensing;Earth;Support vector machines;Satellites;Conferences;Classification algorithms","land cover;remote sensing by radar;sensor fusion;support vector machines;synthetic aperture radar","multisensor data;decision fusion method;land cover classification;remote sensing;multisensor fusion;correlated probabilities;Baye theorem;cross conditional dependence;multisensor information sources;binary classification;Beijing;multitemporal synthetic aperture radar;SVM based decision fusion;Tau model","","4","","27","IEEE","29 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it is of significance to obtain first-hand information related to rice such as rice planting extent. In order to timely and accurately obtain the spatial distribution and temporal variations of rice plants, remote sensing techniques have been introduced and applied to achieve this goal, among which the phenological method is unsupervised and can be used to automatically extract rice. However, the phenological methods are strongly dependent on the weather conditions, and the resultant extraction results might be damaged or incomplete. Additionally, the machine learning-based methods are less influenced by the weather contaminations but are restricted by the availability of training samples. In consideration of the challenges of each approach, this study combines these two approaches to extract rice by using the initial phenology-based rice samples as the training samples of machine learning models, thus obtaining more complete results and high accuracy. This strategy is tested in the Central Valley of California, USA, one of the main rice-producing areas in the United States, and is compared with the rice maps derived from Cropland Data Layer (CDL) from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The results show that through the incorporation of the phenology- and machine learning-based methods, the derived rice maps present high consistency with the CDL-rice map, and high accuracy is achieved in terms of OA and Kappa values reaching up to 0.96 and 0.86 respectively, while the purely phenology-based rice map shows great misclassifications thus leading to a sharp decrease in the Kappa value (0.49). This comparison proves the effectiveness of this strategy. The satisfactory results in this study show the possibility of extending this strategy to other regions for rice mapping.","","978-1-7281-6561-5","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics50104.2021.9530301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530301","Rice extraction;Phenology;Cropland Data Layer;Multi-temporal classification","Earth;Training;Learning systems;Artificial satellites;Machine learning;Agriculture;Stability analysis","agriculture;crops;geophysical image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);phenology;remote sensing;vegetation mapping","rice planting extent;temporal variations;rice plants;remote sensing techniques;phenological method;resultant extraction results;machine learning-based methods;training samples;initial phenology-based rice samples;machine learning models;complete results;Central Valley;main rice-producing areas;derived rice maps;CDL-rice map;purely phenology-based rice map;rice mapping;rice extraction;multitemporal landsat images;paddy rice;daily food;food security;market stability","","","","26","IEEE","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Images Co-registration is an important step before the change detection process, and although they are geo-referenced to each other they may not have the same spatial resolution. So, prior to the multi-temporal analysis, images should be similar in pixel size. Using optical sensors with different characteristics and resolutions to obtain the same geographical area may cause effects in change detection results. In this paper; Image difference pixel-based change detection technique is proposed, and the effect of the image pixel size on change detection is studied.

Although the proposed method has principally been developed to work with differential SAR interferograms that form a triangle-shaped network in the temporal/perpendicular baseline plane, as originally exploited by Extended Minimum Cost Flow (EMF) phase unwrapping (PhU) technique, it may simply be adapted to work with any network of time-redundant interferograms. The fundamental idea is to exploit the phase inconsistencies of triples of (already) unwrapped sequence of interferograms, prior to the application of any inversion for the generation of surface displacement time-series, to independently identify, for every SAR pixels, the 2π-multiple integers corrections to be applied to the unwrapped phases for adjusting the time-inconsistent phase unwrapping errors.

In March 2015, Al Jazeera estimated 10.9 million Syrians or almost half the population who have been displaced which has been one of the most severe humanitarian disasters since World War II. Therefore, it is difficult to monitor humanitarian conditions in Syria during the war. Remotely sensed imagery which can record Earth’ s surface information from outer space has been proved to be an efficient and objective data source for evaluating armed conflicts. This paper uses Syria two river basins as research areas. Based on the spatial and temporal scales of the study and the complex characteristics of the crop planting structure in Syria, the region has a total of 12 remote sensing images for 19 months between 2010 and 2017 with 456 remote sensing images. The selected TM/OLI image is selected as a suitable data source for the study. Here, 50 km of two river basins and 5 remote sensing images of each month are intercepted, and a total of 120 remote sensing images are taken to process. Combining crop phenology information, using time series NDVI curves, and comparing the similarity of the NDVI time series curve with the reference time series curve of the to-be-segmented pixels, we established the rules and object-oriented classification method to extract the crop planting structure information of Syria and the two river basins between 2010 and 2017. These include mainly crops of sugar beet, cotton, wheat, and orchards, and analyze the impact of the war on changes in the crop planting structure. The main findings and characteristics are as following:(1)When the ground survey sample cannot be obtained, establishing a rule through the existing crop growth process to select crops whose growth process values are in full compliance with the sample, and establishing reference NDVI time series curves of various crops for object-oriented classification.(2)The experimental results show that during the civil war between the two river basins in Syria during the period from 2010 to 2017, large areas of farmland were abandoned, beet, cotton, wheat, and fruit trees were caused by reduced, and crop yields were reduced by 1/2. The are a of abandoned farmland duringthe Civil War is an important indicator of immigration, death, and trauma. This also explains the great damage caused by the war.(3)The range and total area of crops in Syria and the total area extracted from remote sensing imagery in 2010 are similar to those of survey data. This shows that it is feasible to extract Syria's 2017 crop distribution in accordance with the above-mentioned method and ensure the reliability of the results with authe nticity.","","978-1-5386-5038-7","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2018.8476039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8476039","Structure of crop planting;Multi-temporal data;Time series NDVI;Rule set;Object-oriented classification","Cotton;Rivers;Remote sensing;Time series analysis;Vegetation mapping;Data mining","agriculture;cotton;crops;disasters;environmental factors;geophysical image processing;image classification;remote sensing;rivers;time series;vegetation;vegetation mapping","river basins;Syrian Civil War;10.9 million Syrians;World War II;efficient data source;objective data source;12 remote sensing images;456 remote sensing images;selected TM/OLI image;5 remote sensing images;120 remote sensing images;crop phenology information;time series NDVI curves;NDVI time series curve;reference time series curve;crop planting structure information;existing crop growth process;time series curves;remote sensing imagery;time 19.0 month;size 50.0 km","","","","10","IEEE","30 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unsupervised change detection is an approach to determine the changed and unchanged state of a location without using any label information. The remote sensing images are captured in multiple spectral bands and the extraction of spatial, texture and shape features in each band increases the dimensionality of the data sets.

The output feature vectors from two branches of the pseudo-Siamese network are used to calculate change intensity maps. Then, the binary change map is obtained by setting a proper threshold.

The multi-band temporal texture features obtained are combined with bi-temporal multispectral images to detect urban built-up area change using direct multi-temporal image classification. One-class random forest (OCRF), a recently proposed one-class classifier, is used in multi-temporal image classification by sampling one specific class of interest, i.e., built-up area expansion. Experimental results demonstrated that the incorporation of multi-band temporal textures outperformed that using spectral features alone, with increases of 10.55% and 1.74% in overall accuracy, for SPOT-5 and Sentinel-2 data, respectively. Similarly, its overall accuracy is 11.08% and 0.24% higher than incorporating single-band temporal textures.

In this paper, we address the problem of mites infestation detection using temporal hyperspectral data and also evaluate the potential of using Sentinel-2 data for mites infestation detection. The reflectance data from grape leaves with healthy and low infestations of mites have been collected using spectroradiometer. The hyperspectral remote sensing data is collected from 213 bands with wavelength ranging from 350 nm to 1052 nm during 15th Jan - 18th Feb 2017. Variations observed in the spectral reflectance over time makes the detection based on multitemporal data difficult. Data in 213 narrow contiguous bands is used as feature set for hyperspectral data analysis but this large feature set may cause the over-fitting problem and also poses the requirement of large storage and greater processing time. To avoid this, feature selection using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) has been carried out to get the optimum band set. Features selected by LASSO were fed to classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Logistic Regression (LR) to evaluate their performance. Results suggest that LR based model provides maximum accuracy of 93.24%. In addition to this, to investigate the potential of using Sentinel-2, data in 213 narrow bands were simulated to Sentinel-2. Data has been simulated to 10 and 20m spatial resolution bands available in 350-1050nm range. This simulated 8 band feature set has been fed to the same set of classifiers to evaluate their performance. Results suggests that LR provides maximum classification accuracy of 89.12% using simulated Sentinel-2 bands. Further to validate the algorithm using actual ground observations from the field, we have implemented simulated Sentinel-2 based algorithm on two Sentinel-2 images available during the study period and results are compared with actual ground observations about mites infestation. Results suggest mites detection accuracy of 83.33% which shows the good agreement and potential of Sentinel-2 for mites infestation detection.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-7150-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8519071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519071","Hyperspectral Remote Sensing;Sentinel-2;Pest Infestation;Classification;Multi-temporal Sensing","Pipelines;Hyperspectral imaging;Spectroradiometers;Agriculture;Sensors;Radio frequency","data analysis;geophysical image processing;image resolution;neural nets;remote sensing;spectral analysis;terrain mapping;vegetation;vegetation mapping","Mite;temporal hyperspectral data;Sentinel-2 data;reflectance data;grape leaves;healthy infestations;low infestations;hyperspectral remote sensing data;multitemporal data;hyperspectral data analysis;feature selection;LR based model;Sentinel-2 bands;actual ground observations;Sentinel-2 based algorithm;Sentinel-2 images;mites detection;band feature set;optimum band set;narrow contiguous bands;mites infestation detection;Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator;LASSO;wavelength 350.0 nm to 1052.0 nm;size 350.0 nm to 1050.0 nm;size 10.0 m;size 20.0 m","","","","15","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The research was based on six periods of wet season's cloud free Landsat images which are Landsat MSS for 1973,1980, Landsat TM for 1992, Landsat ETM+ for 2002, 2010 and Landsat OLI/TIRS for 2016.Ratio method and Modified Normalized Differences Water Index (MNDWI) method were used to extract the channel information because they can avoid possible shadowing by mountains and terrain differences. Human-computer interaction was then used to refine the result after the channel information were converted into vector layers in Arcgis. Furthermore, several characteristic factors were applied to describe the migration of river channel based on GIS layers. They include river's length, average width, river area, area change rate and river bend coefficient. Through directly comparing the changes between characteristic factors of six images, we achieved the final result of river channel migration process.The dynamic change of Dagu River channel shows different characteristics during different phases. During the period of 1973-2002, the area and the width of Dagu River generally showed an decreasing trend, although its length presented slightly change. Meanwhile, the river bend coefficient increased continuously.The river channel migration reasons are probably as follows: 1) Water supply decreased since there was an obvious increasing of annual temperature. As a result, evaporation and irrigation water increasd and the flow decreased. 2) The over-exploitation of Dagu River water resources for urban and rural water supply has led to the lowering of water level and flow reduction in Dagu River Basin. And it even presented zero flow in some river sections.For the second stage (2002-2016), the area and the average width of the river channel showed an increasing trend. The average width continuously increased from 220.41 m in 2002 to 395.35 m in 2016. The river bend coefficient is obviously reduced. The average precipitation increased, but there was a slight increasing trend. More recent changes have been attributed to improved hydrologic conditions as a result of river dredging, building sluice and dams, widening the river and curve cutoff works.The changes of the river are the reaction of natural and human factors. This analysis of research relating to the change causes of the Dagu River channel from 1973 to 2016 showed that human activities have come to be as the controlling factor.","","978-1-5386-6642-5","10.1109/EORSA.2018.8598555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8598555","Landsat;Remote Sensing Technology;Channel Information Extraction","Rivers;Remote sensing;Earth;Water resources;Artificial satellites;Market research;Data mining","evaporation;feature extraction;geographic information systems;geophysical image processing;irrigation;remote sensing;rivers;time series;water resources;water supply","Dagu river channel extraction;Dagu River channel migration;multitemporal remote sensing data;Landsat MSS;Landsat TM;Landsat ETM;Modified Normalized Differences Water Index method;channel information;river bend coefficient;river channel migration process;evaporation;Dagu River water resources;urban water supply;rural water supply;Dagu River Basin;river sections;river dredging;Landsat time series;Landsat OLI-TIRS;irrigation water;China;AD 1973 to 2016;Landsat images;ArcGis","","","","14","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most MT-InSAR methods select scatterers with high coherence throughout the entire time series. However, as time series lengthen, inevitable changes in surface scattering lead to decorrelation, which systematically decreases the number of coherent scatterers. Here, we propose a novel method to detect and process temporary coherent scatterers (TCS) by subsequently analyzing the amplitude and the interferometric phase. Two hypothesis tests are developed for amplitude analysis in order to identify the moments of appearing and/or disappearing coherent scatterers. Based on the amplitude analysis, the parameters of interest are then estimated using the interferometric phase. An optimized adaptive temporal subset approach is proposed to improve the precision of the estimated parameters. If the scatterers are not evenly distributed over the area, a secondary (support) network is designed to improve the spatial point distribution. The main advantage of this method is the reliable extraction of a subset of time series without using any contextual information. Experimental results show that the TCSs significantly increase the number of observations for displacement monitoring and improve the change detection capability in urban construction areas.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2915658","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201706260149); State Key Development Program for Basic Research of China(grant numbers:2013CB733304); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41674003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8756305","Change detection;multi-temporal InSAR;Rayleigh distribution;temporary coherent scatterer","Time series analysis;Coherence;Decorrelation;Probability density function;Signal to noise ratio;Synthetic aperture radar","geomorphology;geophysical image processing;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;time series","incorporating temporary coherent scatterers;multitemporal InSAR;adaptive temporal subsets;multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar;MT-InSAR methods select scatterers;high coherence;entire time series;surface scattering lead;interferometric phase;amplitude analysis;disappearing coherent scatterers;optimized adaptive temporal subset approach","","15","","44","OAPA","8 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address these problems, we propose a robust multi-temporal change detection framework for land cover change in mountainous terrain which contains the following contributions. i) To transform multi-temporal remote sensing image pairs acquired by different type of sensors into the same coordinate system by image registration, a multi-scale feature description is generated using layers formed via a pretrained VGG network. ii) A gradually increasing selection of inliers is defined for improving the robustness of feature points registration, and L2-minimizing estimate (L2E)-based energy optimization is formulated to calculate a reasonable position in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. iii) Fuzzy C-Means classifier is adopted to generate a similarity matrix between image pair of geometric correction, and a robust and contractive change map is built through feature similarity analysis. Extensive experiments on multi-temporal image pairs taken by different type of satellites (e.g., Chinese GF and Landsat) or small unmanned aerial vehicles are conducted. Experimental results show that our method provides better performances in most cases after comparing with the five state-of-the-art image registration methods and the four state-of-the-art change detection methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2883254","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41661080); Yunnan Provincial Department of Education(grant numbers:2018Y037); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8552424","LULC change;multi-scale feature description;inliers;L₂E;fuzzy C-Means classifier","Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Image sensors;Sensors;Satellites;Image registration;Distortion","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image registration;land cover;land use;terrain mapping","multiscale feature based land cover change detection;mountainous terrain;multisensor remote sensing images;remote sensing technology;image pair;scale changes;change detection algorithm;high detection rate;robust multitemporal change detection framework;multitemporal remote sensing image pairs;multiscale feature description;feature points registration;minimizing estimate-based energy optimization;robust change map;contractive change map;feature similarity analysis;multitemporal image pairs;state-of-the-art image registration methods;state-of-the-art change detection methods","","13","","46","OAPA","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But the fusing operation cannot separate details information from overall information of buildings, resulting in inaccurate detection of building edge area. To address the above challenges, we propose an Iterative Edge Enhancing Framework (IEEF). The IEEF alleviates the building edge detection difficulty by densely implementing Detail Semantic Enhancement Module in decoding part. This module takes differential features between adjacent scales to explicitly represent the building edge information. Simultaneously, to deal with the classes imbalance problem, a Density-Guided Sampling method dedicated for change detection is proposed to increase the proportion of positive samples during training.

The transmission time can be substantially reduced by properly exploiting the temporal correlation. Multi-temporal images are often affected by sensor, and illumination variations, non-uniform attenuation, atmospheric absorption and other environmental effects which render system changes in them. Most of these changes are gradual and incremental. So a recent image can be predicted from a previous sequence of images if the amount of real land-cover change is limited. Regression based prediction is the most appropriate one in this case as it can quantify the relationships between images obtained by different measurement systems in different environments. FFT regression based temporal prediction is proposed in this paper whereby the least-squares minimization is conducted on the amplitude matrices of the readings via the FFT. For a given model, the value of squared coefficient of determination (R) is always increased beyond the value obtained by conventional regression which is a common quality measure of the chosen model.","","978-1-4673-8343-1","10.1109/CCIE.2015.7399299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7399299","multi-temporal;fft regression;temporal prediction;entropy","Entropy;Sensors;Fabrics","fast Fourier transforms;geophysical image processing;image sequences;minimisation;regression analysis;remote sensing","multitemporal FFT regression;sequential data transmission;multitemporal image analysis;temporal correlation;image sequence;land-cover change;FFT regression based temporal prediction;least-squares minimization;amplitude matrices","","","","12","IEEE","4 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although existing studies have extended from bi-temporal data pair to multi-temporal datasets to derive more plentiful information, there are still two problems to be solved in practical applications. First, change indicators constructed from incoherent feature only cannot characterize the change objects accurately. Second, the results of pixel-level methods are usually presented in the form of the noisy binary map, making the spatial change not intuitive and the temporal change of a single pixel meaningless. In this study, we propose an unsupervised man-made objects change detection framework using both coherent and incoherent features derived from multi-temporal SAR images. The coefficients of variation in time-series incoherent features and the man-made object index (MOI) defined with coherent features are first combined to identify the initial change pixels. Afterwards, an improved spatiotemporal clustering algorithm is developed based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and dynamic time warping (DTW), which can transform the initial results into noiseless object-level patches, and take the cluster center as a representative of the man-made object to determine the change pattern of each patch. An experiment with a stack of 10 TerraSAR-X images in Stripmap mode demonstrated that this method is effective in urban scenes and has the potential applicability to wide area change detection.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2022.000087","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41774006); Shanghai Science and Technology Development Foundation(grant numbers:20dz1201200); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9883009","change detection;multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data;coherent and incoherent features;clustering","Visualization;Change detection algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Urban areas;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Radar polarimetry","geophysical image processing;pattern clustering;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","extraordinary visual appearance;synthetic aperture radar images;difficult research topic;bi-temporal data pair;multitemporal datasets;change indicators;incoherent feature;pixel-level methods;spatial change;temporal change;single pixel meaningless;unsupervised man-made objects change detection framework;coherent features;multitemporal SAR images;time-series incoherent features;man-made object index;initial change pixels;noiseless object-level patches;change pattern;10 TerraSAR-X images;wide area change detection;unsupervised change detection;complex imaging mechanism","","","","30","","9 Sep 2022","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

However, since there is no consensus about the definition of forest degradation, it is difficult to operate its characterization, evaluation and monitoring. Unlike deforestation, forest degradation does not imply a change in land cover and it happens in fine scales and is difficult to detect by means of remote sensors. Images from MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-2, and UAVs form the main source of data for the national forest cover monitoring. The assumption here is that satellite images of different spatial and temporal resolutions as input may affect the measurement of forest degradation. The main objective is to study the influence of the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing images on forest degradation patterns detected. Data of multi-temporal MODIS, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 for an area of Michoacán, Mexico were collected. Forests were classified into primary and secondary status based on the existing land cover maps and visual interpretation of the images.

Existing methods for scene change detection rarely focus on the temporal correlation of bi-temporal features, and are mainly evaluated on small scale scene change detection datasets. In this work, we proposed a CorrFusion module that fuses the highly correlated components in bi-temporal feature embeddings. We first extract the deep representations of the bi-temporal inputs with deep convolutional networks. Then the extracted features will be projected into a lower-dimensional space to extract the most correlated components and compute the instance-level correlation. The cross-temporal fusion will be performed based on the computed correlation in CorrFusion module. The final scene classification results are obtained with softmax layers. In the objective function, we introduced a new formulation to calculate the temporal correlation more efficiently and stably. The detailed derivation of backpropagation gradients for the proposed module is also given. Besides, we presented a much larger scale scene change detection dataset with more semantic categories and conducted extensive experiments on this dataset.

The new index combines NDVI and NDWI to enhance the effective in cyanobacteria identification. A spatio-temporal filtering method is also proposed to remove cloud-cover effect in multi-temporal data. The filtering method consists two steps. The first step is to mask cloud on each single date image by using ACCA algorithm and Landsat-8 OLI cirrus band. The second step is to remove the cloud effect by applying the low rank tensor recovery method. Using the proposed methods, we analyze the water pollution incident of Erie Lake in 2014 with Landsat-8 multi-temporal imagery. The results demonstrated the NDPI and the 3-D tensor filtering methods are apparently applicable.

An alternative to the sporadic and punctual snow water equivalent (SWE) and liquid water content (LWC) measurements is represented by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). We analyze the correlation between the multi-temporal C-band SAR backscattering and the snow melting timing. The backscattering was compared with in situ observations and snow modelling simulations for two test sites in the Alpine region. SAR sensitivity to LWC variation and snow properties enables the identification of the snow melting phases. A strong decrease of the backscattering in correspondence of an increase of LWC, e.g. during the moistening phase, is observed. Furthermore, an increase of backscattering happens in correspondence of SWE decrease, e.g. during the run-off phase. We discuss the possible mechanisms which affect SAR backscattering, related both to LWC and snow structure variations. The presented investigation could have relevant application for monitoring and predicting the snowmelt progress over large regions.","","978-88-907018-8-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8740300","Snow melting;multi-temporal;Synthetic Aperture Radar;Copernicus Sentinel-1","Snow;Backscatter;Synthetic aperture radar;Liquids;Temperature measurement;Atmospheric modeling;Monitoring","hydrological techniques;remote sensing by radar;rivers;snow;synthetic aperture radar","multitemporal Sentinel-1 backscattering;Alpine region;complex process;run-off phase;snow contaminants monitoring;liquid water content measurements;snow melting timing;snow modelling simulations;SAR sensitivity;LWC variation;snow melting phases;moistening phase;ripening phase;snow water equivalent;synthetic aperture radar;multitemporal C-band SAR backscattering;river discharge","","","","9","","20 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the change detection results are not reliable since the amplitude observations are sensitive to the change of surroundings and the types of changes are unknown. Here we propose a new change detection method using an adaptive temporal subset multi-temporal InSAR method. Single pixel change detection is developed using amplitude time series in order to identify the step-times: changes in the temporal domain. Then the parameters, e.g. deformation velocity are estimated and the coherent intervals are determined using interferometric phase time series. With the identified TCS, we distinguish different types of changes based on their coherent intervals. The main advantages of our method are reliable unsupervised change detection and detecting different types of changes without additional information.

Two recent approaches are highlighted in this case study for Belgium and the Netherlands.

Promising results on large scale experiments demonstrate the extreme potentials of our method.","2160-7516","978-1-4673-6759-2","10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7301384","","Measurement;Remote sensing;Satellites;Optimization;Image resolution;Correlation;Computational complexity","duality (mathematics);geophysical image processing;image registration;linear programming;object detection;remote sensing","simultaneous registration;change detection;very high resolution remote sensing data;multitemporal remote sensing data;image registration;metric free single shot change detection method;metric free single shot change registration method;interconnected graphical model formulation;registration similarity constraints;deformation space discretization;linear programming;duality principles","","20","","26","IEEE","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accurate evaluation of rice planted area and spatial distribution are significant for the estimation ofgrain output and cropland allocation. Meanwhile, paddy rice is a main contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and therefore its cultivation and spatial distribution have significant implications for rising temperatures and global climate change. In southeast China, even though paddy rice is widely cultivated, the paddy rice field is highly fragmented by other land use/cover. The difficulty in mapping small and fragmented rice fields is further exacerbated by the cloudy weather conditions in this area at periods corresponding to the rice growing season which impedes the utility of optical images. As optical data possess important spectral information which cannot be provided by satellite sensors (radar) least affected by weather conditions, much attention should be paid to the optimal use of optical data. GF-1 is an optical satellite launched in China on April 26, 2013 and has been providing remotely-sensed images with multispectral data of relatively high spatial and temporal resolution. Despite its better resolution and freely available 16 m products, the application of GF-1 images in agricultural land-cover studies, especially in paddy rice mapping, is not as popular as other optical products such as Landsat, MODIS, SPOT and so on. In this study, we have employed multi-temporal images of GF-1 covering the 2016 rice growing season to map paddy rice cultivated fields in Tongxiang County, Zhejiang Province, China. The radiometric and geometric corrections were first carried out for multiple temporal GF-1 images. These corrected images were layer-stacked to enable time series analysis. Since the two-band enhanced vegetation (EVI2) is changing with paddy rice growth stages, we extracted and smoothed the EVI2 temporal series from GF-1 images using the Savitzky-Golay filter (S_G filter) approach to further reduce the influence of atmospheric effects from clouds and water vapor. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm was then introduced on the temporal and filtered GF-1 images to map paddy rice fields in the area investigated. Classification results show two major types of rice crop planting patterns in Tongxiang County: single-cropped rice fields and paddy rice-upland crop rotation fields. The former cropping pattern is more uniformly distributed in Tongxiang County, whereas the latter mainly occupies the western and northern parts of the County. From the error matrix, overall classification accuracy, user's accuracy and producer's accuracy are the approximately 87.68%, 88.8% and 90.3%, respectively. These results indicate the promising potential of GF-1 temporal images in extracting paddy rice cultivated areas with higher accuracy in irregular and highly fragmented paddy rice cultivated areas.","","978-1-5386-3884-2","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2017.8047022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8047022","GF-1;paddy rice;S_G filter;SVM","Agriculture;Support vector machines;Vegetation mapping;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution;Optical filters;Radiometry;Climate change","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;support vector machines;time series;vegetation;vegetation mapping","paddy rice field mapping;rice planted area;spatial distribution;fragmented rice fields;rice growing season;optical images;optical data;relatively high spatial resolution;temporal resolution;multitemporal images;Tongxiang County;multiple temporal GF-1 images;paddy rice growth stages;temporal filtered GF-1 images;map paddy rice fields;rice crop planting patterns;paddy rice-upland crop rotation fields;GF-1 temporal images;extracting paddy rice;irregular paddy rice cultivated areas;highly fragmented paddy rice cultivated areas;Zhejiang Province;China;two-band enhanced vegetation;Support Vector Machine;SVM classification algorithm","","3","","21","IEEE","21 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At present, mapping debris-covered glaciers and estimating glacier mass balances are one of the most challenging issues. This study illustrates the use of remote sensing techniques for glacier mapping and change detection, with multi-temporal and multi-source data. We show contrasting behavior of different type glaciers (temperate, semi-continental and continental) in three typical densely glacierized sub-regions of the plateau, mainly based on elevation data from ICESat and Landsat imagery.

If the discrepancies in the areas of moderate coherence share similar behaviour, it appears important to take into account their spatial correlation for correct inference. Low coherence areas thus could serve as clear indicators of measurement noise or imperfections in mathematical models.

Multi-temporal GF-1 WFV images of Xinghua City, Jiangsu Province were selected for rice growth parameter retrieval. An extensive field campaign was carried out during the rice growing season in 2015. Six rice sample plots with areas larger than 200 × 200 m2 in Xinghua City were randomly chosen in order to measure the vegetation characteristics. Only cloud-free images were selected for AGB modeling. Using Savitzky-Golay filters, daily vegetation indices (VIs) time series were created from all the GF-1 images. For modeling of AGB from GF-1, there were 42 matching AGB sample sites. The matched cumulative VIs were calculated from 10-day composite data and were adopted for the estimation of AGB. Five traditional regression equations (linear, exponential, power, logarithmic, and quadratic polynomial regression) were applied in model construction. The leave-one-out cross-validation method was implemented to test the prediction capability of the models. The cumulative NDVI-based quadratic polynomial fit function was adopted for the prediction of AGB at all stages. In this paper, the application provided an important reference of field management and decision-making information. Indicated that GF-1 satellite's high time resolution provides chances to get cloudless data, and high spatial and spectral resolution features can replace the traditional medium resolution remote sensing of agricultural growth monitoring data to a certain extent, but a lot of ground survey data still needed to improve model and monitoring accuracy. This research shows that GF-1 WFV is an important data source and the data's application in other areas of agriculture is the focus of future research.","","978-1-5386-3884-2","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2017.8047018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8047018","rice growth monitoring;aboveground biomass (AGB);cumulative vegetation indices;GF-1 WFV images","Mathematical model;Agriculture;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution;Biomass;Monitoring;Vegetation mapping","geophysical image processing;regression analysis;time series;vegetation mapping","AGB model;high spatial resolution feature;spectral resolution feature;medium resolution remote sensing;China remote sensing;high-resolution GaoFen-1 satellite;multitemporal GF-1 WFV image;rice sample plot;cloud-free image;AGB sample site;image matching;multitemporal Chinese GF-1 image;quadratic polynomial regression;10-day composite data;daily vegetation indices time series;rice growing season;extensive field campaign;rice growth parameter retrieval;Xinghua City;plant growth indicator;rice growth monitoring;quadratic polynomial fit function","","","","13","IEEE","21 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At this test site we use data from three different SAR sensors: ALOS PALSAR, Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X. The forest disturbance maps are validated by visual interpretation and compared to the Landsat based Humid Tropical Forest Disturbance Alerts available from Global Forest Watch. Change mapping accuracies for plots larger than 0.5 ha are very high: 76% for ALOS PALSAR, 96% for TerraSAR-X and 98% for Sentinel-1. For Sentinel-1, producer accuracies were derived for different forest disturbance types. The overall accuracy is 81.8%, with highest values for deforestation in oil palm plantations and burnt areas. The results are similar to the accuracy of the Humid Tropical Forest Disturbance Alert layer, which detects 85.6% of all reference areas. We also show that fusion of the disturbance maps on a result level is possible.

In this paper, we introduce a segmentation method for multi-temporal PolSAR images based on the simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) framework. We apply the Wishart distribution-based distance and modify the combination form for the SLIC distance measure such that the SLIC method can be adapted to the statistical characteristics of PolSAR imagery. Compared with existing PolSAR image superpixel methods, the proposed method has better time cost efficiency while maintaining the performance on segmentation results. Moreover, the proposed method is capable of jointly segmenting two or more multi-temporal PolSAR images, which is the basis for some further earth observation applications such as change detection and region-based data fusion tasks.","","978-1-5386-1211-8","10.1109/PIERS-FALL.2017.8293217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8293217","","Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Electromagnetics;Task analysis;Remote sensing;Speckle","geophysical image processing;image classification;image segmentation;iterative methods;pattern clustering;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","PolSAR imagery;multitemporal PolSAR images;superpixel segmentation;image processing tasks;image classification;polarimetric synthetic aperture radar image processing;segmentation method;simple linear iterative clustering framework;region-based change detection;PolSAR image superpixel methods;Wishart distribution-based distance","","4","","7","IEEE","19 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most importantly, an obvious acceleration was detected from the time series analysis of selected measurement points at the source area before the occurrence of failure.

Modeled forest stand height is then validated with ground truth samples, and its accuracy is quantified with an RMSE of 2.74 m and r2 of 0.76. A year-wise average backscatter of SAR imagery acquired from 2014 to 2018 was computed and used as a predictor variable along with the interpolated forest stand height in support vector machine regression analysis to estimate forest above ground biomass. The results showed that the average backscatter computed for acquisitions during 2017 combined with interpolated forest stand height performed better with RMSE less than 40 Mg/ha and r2 above 0.70.

It is a basaltic shield volcano with a summit caldera of dimension 5×6.5 km. Recently, the volcano erupted on January 12, 2020, preceded by a seismic shock of magnitude 4.7 at a depth of 5 km. The subsequent seismic activities have led to the formation of a circumferential fissure below the La Cumbre crater's eastern rim, at an elevation of 1.3-1.4 km. The lava flow has occurred down the flank to the sea through this fissure. This volcanic episode has continued up to 9 hours. The InSAR time series method is a multi-temporal InSAR technique used to detect slowly occurring deformations with a millimeter level of precision using a stack of SAR interferograms. In this paper, the Differential InSAR has been used to analyze Fernandina volcano's surface deformation due to this recent eruption. The interferograms of the volcano before, during, and after the eruption have been analyzed in detail using the freely available Sentinel 1 C-band datasets from 2019 December 17 to 2020 February 09. The integration of all these analyses gives an insight into the underground magma conduit system, the correlation between the magmatic and seismic activities, surface deformations, and the lava flow channels, which have been discussed in detail in this paper.","","978-1-7281-3114-6","10.1109/InGARSS48198.2020.9358954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9358954","DInSAR;Deformation;Crater;Seismic;circumferential eruption;fissure;lava","Sea surface;Time series analysis;Geoscience and remote sensing;Volcanoes;Synthetic aperture radar;Strain;Interferometry","deformation;geomorphology;geophysical techniques;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;seismology;synthetic aperture radar;time series;volcanology","Fernandina volcano;active volcano;Galapagos archipelago;basaltic shield volcano;summit caldera;January 12, 2020;seismic shock;subsequent seismic activities;circumferential fissure;La Cumbre crater;volcanic episode;InSAR time series method;multitemporal InSAR technique;SAR interferograms;Differential InSAR;recent eruption;freely available Sentinel 1 C-band datasets;magmatic activities;surface deformations;lava flow channels;DInSAR","","","","9","IEEE","23 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This basin extends over 746 km2, at an altitude of 2780 m, with a very rough terrain and frequent torrential water flow. Due to the continuous extension of greenhouses in the east and west parts of Almería, the water demand for agriculture and urban consumption increases day by day. As a consequence, aquifers are being overexploited, causing the current system to not be sustainable for a long time, that is, the storage capacity of the underground media and their possible contributions to an efficient management of resources have not been adequately taken into account.

Multi-temporal co-polarized and cross-polarized response is compared to volumetric insitu soil moisture for two crops with contrasting biomass and plant height, namely soybean and corn. The considered dataset is comprised by several soybean and corn fields, whose response to microwaves is averaged leading to an overall assessment for each crop. For canopies with large stalks such as corn, observations suggest an important contribution of the double bounce mechanism when soil surface is wet.

They are planted in a wide range and account for a high proportion of the total grain output. Quick and accurate acquisition of Dryland Crop Planting area can provide decision support for agricultural production managers, provide basis for food policy formulation, and provide guarantee for national food security. Different from the initial stage of rice growth, the underlying surface water layer and rice plant can form obvious dihedral angle, which can produce strong backscatter to microwave. Intercropping and interplanting of dryland crops are common, and the planting structure is complex, so it is difficult to identify them. At present, there is a lack of research on scattering characteristics of Dryland crops, and the universality of recognition methods is also poor, which leads to the low accuracy of dry land crop recognition based on SAR data. The purpose of studying the scattering characteristics of dryland crops and their changes with time is to provide basis for the identification of dryland crops and improve the classification accuracy. This paper chooses Jizhou City, Hebei Province as the research area, and takes corn and cotton as the research objects. The full polarization RADARSAT -2 data of three phases in 2018 (July 17, August 7 and September 24) were used. The changes of basic scattering characteristics (average scattering angle, entropy, volume scattering, dihedral angle scattering, surface scattering) of crops with different target decomposition methods (Cloude-Pottier, Freeman, Yamaguchi) were studied and compared, and the proportion of basic scattering power and its changing trend at different growth stages were analyzed. The results showed that the counter-entropy of the two crops changed little in the whole growth period, and mainly consisted of surface scattering and volume scattering. For corn, with the growth of crops, the entropy and average scattering angle increased first and then decreased, the proportion of surface scattering power decreased from 67% to 48% and then increased to 55%, and the proportion of volume scattering power increased from 33% to 52% and then decreased to 45%. On August 7, the volume scattering power is greater than the surface scattering power. For cotton, with the increase of crop growth entropy and average scattering angle, the proportion of surface scattering power decreases from 66% to 54%, and the volume scattering power increases from 33% to 46%. The surface scattering power is larger than volume scattering in the whole growth period. This study will help to determine the scattering mechanism of corn and cotton, and provide reference for the study of scattering characteristics of other dryland crops.","","978-1-7281-2116-1","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820479","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820479","dryland crops;multi-temporal;scattering characteristics","Scattering;Cotton;Covariance matrices;Urban areas;Monitoring;Entropy","agriculture;crops;geophysical image processing;image classification;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;vegetation mapping","surface scattering power;rice plant;dry land crop recognition;basic scattering characteristics;average scattering angle;dihedral angle scattering;basic scattering power;volume scattering power;crop growth entropy;surface water layer;Dryland crop planting area;planting structure","","","","15","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An example of synergy is the ingestion of surface information derived from Sentinel data in numerical weather prediction models. The rationale is that Sentinels 1, 2 and 3 are able to provide high spatio-temporal resolution information on the surface boundary (as well as the atmosphere column) and that an inaccurate representation of the boundary conditions represents a major source of uncertainty for weather forecasts. For a profitable ingestion of EO data in numerical weather prediction models, a critical aspect is the choice of a suitable model. Once the numerical model is chosen, the problem of the selection of the Sentinel-derived surface variables that have to be ingested in the model has to be tackled. While some data, such as sea and land surface temperature, are directly available, other surface data, such as soil moisture, have to be retrieved. Being STEAM currently in its initial phase, this paper gives a general overview of the project and focuses on the first activities performed in its framework. In particular, it describes the rationale behind the choice of the Numerical Weather Prediction Model and the multi-temporal approach designed to retrieve soil moisture from Sentinel-1 data. Moreover, the first results of the ingestion of Sentinel derived soil moisture, land surface temperature and sea surface temperature data into the selected model are shown.

Existing methods focus on the change information of multi-temporal remote sensing images, ignoring the exploration of pseudochange problems. Therefore, feature-output space dual-alignment (FODA) method is proposed to reduce the negative effect of the pseudochange problem by paying attention to the relationship between unchanged areas of multitemporal images. On the one hand, FODA narrows the distance between the features of the unchanged areas in the feature space, increasing its feature extraction ability of pseudo-changed areas. On the other hand, given the spatial context of image scene implicit in the output space, the ability to recognize pseudochanges of the FODA is improved through an adversarial learning procedure. Due to its simplicity and effectiveness, FODA achieves 88.73% and 82.75% F1 scores on the LEVIR-CD dataset and WHU-CD dataset respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, FODA can effectively reduce the problem of pseudo-changes and significantly improve the effect of change detection even only based on a simple backbone model.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3103429","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0503503); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41671357); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2020JJ4691); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9512515","Adversarial learning;change detection;feature space alignment;output space alignment;pseudochange","Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Buildings;Task analysis;Semantics;Image segmentation;Manuals","buildings (structures);feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing","FODA;high-resolution remote sensing images;building change detection task;multitemporal remote sensing images;feature-output space dual-alignment method;multitemporal images;feature extraction;image scene;LEVIR-CD dataset;WHU-CD dataset;adversarial learning procedure","","6","","30","CCBY","12 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we apply a temporal averaging filter that allows encapsulating the temporal variations in coastal areas, e.g. due to tides or vegetation, and at the same time it allows reducing the speckle, without decreasing the spatial resolution of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Then, based on the distinctive backscattering values of the sea and land classes we employ an iterative hierarchical tiling method in order to accurately characterize the two classes by a bimodal distribution.

For economic studies, NTLs allow to proxy for levels of economic indicators at the country level as well as the local level. Further, multi-temporal differences in NTL intensity are also related to GDP differences on the country level. In this study, we investigate if this relation in temporal differences also holds for the local level. We test this with DMSP as well as VIIRS NTLs data from 2010–2015 in Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda. Even though we successfully map local levels of socio-economic status with NTLs, we find multi-temporal changes in NTLs at this local level to be uncorrelated with socio-economic development over time. We conclude that luminosity values based on current DMSP and VIIRS sensors are no silver bullet in measuring local economic changes over time and should, if at all, only be used with caution for this.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554428","European Research Council (ERC)(grant numbers:ERC-2016-StG-714087); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9554428","Nighttime Lights;Change Detection;Poverty Mapping;Sustainable Development Goals","Graphical models;Correlation;Economic indicators;Current measurement;Geoscience and remote sensing;Time measurement;Sensors","economic indicators;economics;remote sensing;socio-economic effects","monitoring local economic development;nighttime light emissions;economic studies;economic indicators;country level;multitemporal differences;NTL intensity;GDP differences;VIIRS NTLs data;map local levels;socio-economic status;multitemporal changes;socio-economic development;local economic changes","","","","9","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides, several conventional techniques for controlling and monitoring anarchic urban expansion have been initiated but they remain not sufficient to overcome this issue. This paper proposes an automatic method of detection and monitoring of anarchic urban expansions starting from multi-sources and multi-temporal data (VHR satellite images and geographic information data). First, the illegal urban areas are extracted using an original SVM based technique integrating expert knowledge and auxiliary data by means of ontology construction. This leads to the formalization of the expert semantic information and the urban construction rules (often in sentences form) and their confrontation with the classification results. Secondly, a spatio-temporal regions' similarity framework is proposed using a novel matrix based on Multi-dimensional histograms Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). To this end, an explicit definition of a Spatio-Temporal Region (STR) is given in order to build its characteristic matrix called Multi-Temporal Region Matrix (MTRM). Afterwards, using this matrix, a Cross-STR Similarity Matrix (CSTRSM) is computed between STR of in order to reveal regions with similar temporal fingerprint. The resulted spatio-temporal map describes urban areas types and their temporal changes.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8898732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8898732","Expert Knowledge Formalization;STIS analysis;STM;STR;EMD;etc.","Monitoring;Buildings;Ontologies;Satellites;Earth;Histograms;Remote sensing","geographic information systems;geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;matrix algebra;ontologies (artificial intelligence);remote sensing;support vector machines;time series","anarchic urban expansion;multitemporal data;VHR satellite images;geographic information data;illegal urban areas;original SVM based technique;auxiliary data;expert semantic information;urban construction rules;spatio-temporal regions;Multidimensional histograms Earth Mover's Distance;MultiTemporal Region Matrix;Cross-STR Similarity Matrix;spatio-temporal map;urban areas types;temporal changes;VHR Satellite Image Time Series analysis;illegal building monitoring;Multidimensional histogram Earth Mover's Distance;remote sensing;land cover observation;temporal fingerprint","","1","","9","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The government department of plant protection normally collects the crop pest and disease information by manual inspection, which is unable to provide timely and spatially continuous crop growth status and pest/ disease development over large areas. The manuscript aims to bring together and produce cutting edge research to provide crop pest and disease monitoring and forecasting information, integrating multi-source (Earth Observation-EO, meteorological, entomological and plant pathological, etc.) to support decision making in sustainable management of pest and disease. Taking national disease –a fungal disease of wheat rust and national pest – a serious insect pest locust as the experimental object, we conducted the following research: 1) the sensitive spectral features of rust and locust with capability of stresses differentiation would be identified or formed based on field hyperspectral data and UAV hyperspectral images for detection, 2) multi-sources of data that are composed by remote sensing images (eg. GF, Landsat and Sentinel) and meteorological observations would be integrated to evaluating habitat of rust and locust in farmland level, 3) multi-temporal remote sensing images and vegetation ecological dataset are combined to provide environmental information of rust and locust dispersion, and forecast the damaged areas and levels in regional scales. Moreover, an automatic system is developed to do the disease and pest timeseries monitoring and forecasting, also the visual display of the thematic maps and analysis reports. The system is constructed based on WebGIS platform. It selected Browser/Server (B/S) architecture, access the system interface through a web browser, simple, quick and easy to operate. And, it could timely, efficiently, quantitatively do the extraction and analysis of crop pest and disease occurrence and developing information, also produce pest and disease thematic maps and scientific report. The crop pest and disease monitoring and forecasting system, can provide effective information of pest and disease developing for our agricultural sector, provide a scientific basis to formulate pest and disease prevention and control measures, and also provide data basis and technical support for the crop network management. Based on the system, we analysed the damaged situation and changes of national wheat rust in 2019, and locust in Tianjing 2019. The results would not only promote efficacy of pest and disease management and prevention by improving the accuracy of monitoring and forecasting, but also help to reduce the amount of chemical pesticides, which could thus guarantee the food security and sustainable development of agriculture in China.","","978-1-7281-2116-1","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820620","crop;pest;disease;monitoring;forecasting;system","Diseases;Monitoring;Forecasting;Agriculture;Remote sensing;Climate change;Land surface temperature","agriculture;autonomous aerial vehicles;crops;decision making;diseases;ecology;geographic information systems;geophysical image processing;pest control;remote sensing;sustainable development;vegetation;vegetation mapping","pest disease;crop pest;disease information;crop growth status;disease monitoring;forecasting information;national disease -a fungal disease;national pest;serious insect pest locust;multitemporal remote sensing images;pest timeseries;disease occurrence;developing information;disease thematic maps;scientific report;forecasting system;disease prevention;control measures;crop network management;disease management;monitoring forecasting","","5","","12","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pixel unmixing (PU) can be applied to improve this situation through deriving the abundances and generating the fractional change map. Thus it can be regarded as a more reasonable tool to monitor the sub-pixel changes. In this paper a new sub-pixel land-cover change detection method based on PU and EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm is proposed.

In this framework, monitoring oil and gas offshore platforms is a key topic taken into account the high risk of accident, e.g. exposed to extreme weather conditions, and the potential threats to the environment, e.g. release of polluting material into the ocean. In this study, offshore platform monitoring is discussed using multi-polarization X-band SAR imagery. For operational purposes, the analysis is undertaken using a data set of dual-polarization TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (TS-X/TD-X) imagery collected over a test site in Gulf of Mexico at low and high incidence angles. Additionally, experimental Dual Receive Antenna (DRA) bistatic quad-polarization TD-X data will be used for a more in depth analysis of the backscattering properties and detection performance of different target polarimetric detectors. The motivation behind this work is the observation that, under low incidence angle and moderate wind conditions, co-polarized channels may fail in detecting offshore platforms even when fine-resolution imagery is considered. The multi-temporal dataset allows investigating the possible causes of this unexpected behavior and to draw some conclusions on the target's backscattering depending on polarization, resolution and incidence angle.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-4951-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8127851","SAR;polarimetry;radar;target detection;oil platform","Synthetic aperture radar;Backscatter;Remote sensing;Image resolution;Oils;Earth","environmental monitoring (geophysics);oceanographic regions;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","wind conditions;copolarized channels;offshore backscattering analysis;multipolarization TerraSAR-X-TanDEM-X data;dual-polarization TerraSAR-X-TanDEM-X;dual receive antenna bistatic quad-polarization TD-X data;polarimetric detectors;satellite-based synthetic aperture radar;Mexico Gulf;multipolarization X-band SAR imagery;offshore platform monitoring;gas offshore platforms;maritime safety","","","","4","IEEE","4 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The extremely flat physiography of the Indus River floodplain in conjunction with its proximity to the Himalayas and the distribution of winter westerly rain and rain from the Indian Summer Monsoon combine to produce a distinctive environmental zone where water availability is extremely seasonal, has significant variability, and can produce very active fluvial processes. This variability had enormous consequences for early human habitation of the Indus zone. The relict Ghaggar-Hakra and its tributaries, for example, once extended much of the eastern part of the Indus River basin and appear to have supported concentrations of settlements across greater Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan in India and Punjab in Pakistan.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data present several favourable characteristics for flood mapping, such as their relative insensitivity to the meteorological conditions during acquisitions, thanks to the use of microwaves as sensing radiation, as well as the possibility of acquiring imagery independently of solar illumination, thanks to the active nature of the radar sensors. The Italian COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) SAR constellation is particularly useful in this respect, because it allows image sequences of flooding events to be built up with short revisit times. The acquisition of several images before, during and after the event often allow a reconstruction of the flooding dynamics. Moreover, they help in interpreting the backscatter signatures of different land cover types, reducing uncertainties about the actual presence of water, which can be seriously misleading, especially over agricultural areas [1, 2]. Finally, when acquisitions are made from the same geometry, with short repeat intervals, SAR interferometry (InSAR) observables, such as the coherence or the differential InSAR phase can be exploited as additional information layers. The favorable characteristics of these next-generation sensors have been exploited by a number of researchers worldwide [3, 4, 5] to improve performances of flood mapping approaches. Recently, our group [6, 2] has used high-resolution CSK radar images for flood mapping exploiting both the intensity and the interferometric coherence, with promising results. Nevertheless, additional information can be used to improve flood detection. In case of flooding, distance from the river, terrain elevation, hydrologic information or some combination of these data can add useful information that leads to a better performance in flood detection.","2153-7003","978-1-4799-7929-5","10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7326034","","Synthetic aperture radar;Rivers;Coherence;Bayes methods;Backscatter;Floods;Earth","belief networks;floods;geophysical image processing;hydrological techniques;land cover;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;vegetation mapping","Bayesian network;SAR intensity fusion;data fusion;InSAR coherence imagery;InSAR ancillary data;flooded area;land cover type;hydraulic model;topographic model;satellite mapping;agricultural areas;backscatter flood signature;vegetation area;automatic classifier;coherence flood signature;Bradano river","","1","","14","IEEE","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this contribution, a jointly tropospheric correction scheme is proposed to simultaneously estimate stratified tropospheric delays with deformation and topographic errors. Spatial variability of tropospheric properties is addressed through a localized estimation which is derived by quadtree segmentation according to height gradient.

Furthermore, the estimates of the DEM errors and the ground displacement rate can be used within advanced DInSAR processing chains for the retrieval of surface deformation time-series, with the aim to facilitate phase unwrapping operations and discriminate the desired signals (due to deformation) from residual phase artifacts. The first experimental results, carried out by applying the proposed method to stacks of simulated interferograms, demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-4951-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8127827","synthetic aperture radar;DInSAR;DEM errors;ground mean displacement rate;phase unwrapping","Synthetic aperture radar;Strain;Interferometry;Estimation;Image reconstruction;Standards","deformation;digital elevation models;geomorphology;geophysical techniques;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","differential SAR;phase unwrapping errors;digital elevation models;wrapped multitemporal DInSAR interferograms;surface displacement rate retrieval;DEM correction;simulated interferograms;residual phase artifacts;phase unwrapping operation;surface deformation time-series;advanced DInSAR processing chains;ground displacement rate","","","","15","IEEE","4 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three paddocks of approximately 100 ha planted with dryland wheat were chosen as experimental fields where ground samples for calibration and validation were collected over five field campaigns scheduled to capture the major growth stages of wheat. The Water-Cloud Model (WCM) was used to delineate the at-surface scattering coefficient into vegetation and soil surface components, then a linear model associating the surface soil moisture directly to the soil scattering was combined to retrieve soil moisture from the surface scattering coefficient. The retrieved X-band soil moisture content in comparison with the ground-based soil moisture measurement exhibited accuracy in the range of 0.025-0.058 m3m-3 for the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and 0.22-0.52 for the coefficient of determination (R2).

This study utilizes three Landsat images at different time phases for testing this proposed method, and uses traditional classification results for evaluation.

The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of using Sentinel-1A C-band SAR data for classifying citrus in Florida. Twelve individual citrus classifications produced using single date optical or SAR data, as well as multi-date optical and SAR data fusion, are designed and tested. It is found that the classification accuracies of Sentinel-l C-band SAR data are slightly lower than those of multi-temporal cloud free optical data (approximately 2.5% difference).

In this study, a pragmatic method is presented for spatial upscaling of ground LAI measurements to the product pixel grid.

This paper proposes an edge feature extraction method for remote sensing image edges based on a generative confrontation strategy. This method first designs a CycleGAN network based on the Smooth L1 loss function to meet the requirements of robust feature extraction for edges with semantic information in remote sensing images. The network transfers the style of remote sensing images, and finally extracts edge feature for the images after the style transfer, which is used as the description of the robust features on the surface. Experimental results show that the edge extraction model designed in this paper improves the accuracy of robust feature extraction of remote sensing images by 8.1%. In addition, the method is less affected by environmental factors such as illumination, and can realize the intelligent extraction of robust features of the remote sensing image.

It's of practical value to quickly assess the leaf area index (LAI) of sugarcane and evaluate its growing state. Field-based or in situ measurements are very labor intensive and time consuming, while satellite images are relatively coarse and unsuitable for real-time crop monitoring, not to mention the cloud-prone climate in south China. In this study, an automatic image processing technique is proposed for the estimation of sugarcane LAI using digital images. The test site is a sugarcane plantation in Guangxi province, southern China. In our experiment, a digital video camera was fixed on a 6.0 m pole to acquire sugarcane images during the entire sugarcane growing season. Reference data were also collected through field-based LAI measurement using a portable handheld leaf area meter. The daily acquired sugarcane images were processed in a MATLAB environment and the different color vegetation indices were extracted from the time series digital images. The linear relationship between different color vegetation indices and field-measured sugarcane LAI values were established. The color vegetation indices with the highest correlation coefficients with field-measured LAI were chosen to fit and test the model against the ground-measured LAI values. Based on the root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination R2 between field-measured LAI and model-predicted LAI, we concluded that the most suitable color index for sugarcane LAI estimation during the complete growth period was G-B, and the most appropriate image shooting time for use in the construction of the estimation model for sugarcane LAI was confirmed and also proposed for further studies.","","978-1-5090-2350-9","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2016.7577689","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7577689","sugarcane;LAI;digital image;color vegetation indices;estimation model","Image color analysis;Indexes;Mathematical model;Vegetation mapping;Estimation;Agriculture;Digital images","agricultural engineering;agriculture;crops;image processing;least mean squares methods;time series;vegetation mapping","leaf area index estimation;sugarcane;multitemporal digital images;satellite imaging;real-time crop monitoring;south China;image processing;Guangxi province;Matlab;color vegetation indices;root mean square error;RMSE;image shooting time;image construction","","2","","15","IEEE","29 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the framework of supervised classification, we propose an approach to deal with such lighting and atmospheric temporal fluctuations without reference measurement. Assuming that materials to the surface objects to be discriminated is Lambertian, we show that the difference in lighting conditions after a log-transformation of both reflectance and radiance signals can be expressed as an additive effect. This effect remains additive after the use of a linear dimension reduction method and can be efficiently estimated in a low dimensional feature space. In the feature space, this difference in ligthing can be estimated and thus corrected by finding the translation for which the class densities obtained for each image best overlaps (using cross correlation). This novel approach was applied on a remote sensing data set over the Quiberon peninsula France. For the tested images, classification results obtained with this approach were comparable to those obtained using a classical reflectance correction technique.","2153-7003","978-1-4799-7929-5","10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7326759","Classification;inter-image variation;correction","Reflectivity;Hyperspectral imaging;Lighting;Atmospheric measurements;Atmospheric modeling","geophysical image processing;light sources","multitemporal hyperspectral data classification;reflectance correction;light source;remote hyperspectral image;data processing;supervised classification;atmospheric temporal fluctuation;Lambertian;log-transformation;radiance signals;additive effect;linear dimension reduction method;remote sensing data set;Quiberon peninsula;France","","1","","11","IEEE","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Satellite remote sensing data, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery, have been used for identifying landslides. SAR data possess several benefits, such as the ability to penetrate the clouds, operate day and night, and regular revisit time. However, processing SAR data require large amounts of data downloaded to the local system to be processed on a local computer. This study explored the SAR-based amplitude change detection approach using multi-temporal and multi-orbit (ascending and descending) Sentinel-1 data to identify landslides utilizing the cloud computing platform of Google Earth Engine (GEE), which aimed to assist in rapid response in mapping and inventorying landslide location data. This study took two case studies in the Lebak Regency, Banten Province, and Masamba Regency, South Sulawesi Province. Additional topographic data was used to filter out the flat areas which were unlikely to suffer from landslides. For comparison, this study also identified landslides using Sentinel-2 supported optical images on the GEE platform. In this study, the overall value of landslide mapping accuracy is 97.66% on Sentinel-2 and 68.75% on Sentinel-1 for the case study in the Lebak Regency, Banten Province. In comparison, the case study in the Masamba Regency, South Sulawesi Province, shows the overall value of landslide mapping accuracy of 96.69% in Sentinel-2 and 87.6% on Sentinel-1. Thus, the benefits of Sentinel-2 over Sentinel-1 are associated with the resulting accuracy. Still, optical-based images have a weakness in quick response efforts because optical images require sunlight and cloud/shadow-free conditions to spot landslides accurately.","2474-2333","978-1-7281-7333-7","10.1109/APSAR52370.2021.9688356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9688356","Landslide Mapping;Synthetic Aperture Radar;Google Earth Engine;Sentinel-1;Sentinel-2","Optical filters;Earth;Cloud computing;Laser radar;Satellites;Optical imaging;Terrain factors","cloud computing;disasters;geomorphology;geophysical image processing;geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;geophysics computing;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;terrain mapping","landslide mapping accuracy;Sentinel-2 data;landslides identification;Google Earth Engine;accurate landslide mapping;landslide events;satellite remote sensing data;optical imagery;identifying landslides;SAR data;SAR-based amplitude change detection approach;Sentinel-1 data;inventorying landslide location data;South Sulawesi Province;additional topographic data;identified landslides;Sentinel-2 supported optical images","","","","46","IEEE","26 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Methods for detecting changes in multi-temporal satellite images are very useful tools when characterization and monitoring of urban growth patterns is concerned. Increasing worldwide availability of multispectral images with a high revisit frequency opened up more possibilities in the study of urban CD. Even though there exists several deep learning methods for CD, most of these available methods fail to predict the edges and preserve the shape of the changed area from multispectral images. This article introduces a deep learning model called urban CD network (UCDNet) for urban CD from bi-temporal multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. The model is based on an encoder–decoder architecture which uses modified residual connections and the new spatial pyramid pooling (NSPP) block, giving better predictions while preserving the shape of changed areas. The modified residual connections help locate the changes correctly, and the NSPP block can extract multiscale features and will give awareness about global context. UCDNet uses a proposed loss function which is a combination of weighted class categorical cross-entropy (WCCE) and modified Kappa loss. The Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) dataset is used to train, evaluate, and compare the proposed model with the benchmark models. UCDNet gives better results from the reference models used here for comparison. It gives an accuracy of 99.3%, an  $F1$  score ( $F1$ ) of 89.21%, a Kappa coefficient (Ka) of 88.85%, and a Jaccard index (JI) of 80.53% on the OSCD dataset.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3161337","RESPOND Scheme of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Government of India (December 30, 2019)(grant numbers:ISRO/RES/4/683/19-20); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9740122","Change detection (CD);deep learning;multi-spectral satellite images;spatial pyramid pooling (SPP)","Feature extraction;Convolution;Satellites;Remote sensing;Deep learning;Streaming media;Shape","deep learning (artificial intelligence);entropy;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image segmentation;object detection;remote sensing;town and country planning","JI;Jaccard index;Kappa coefficient;OSCD dataset;F1 score;Onera satellite change detection dataset;modified Kappa loss;WCCE;weighted class categorical cross-entropy;NSPP block;new spatial pyramid pooling block;encoder-decoder architecture;earth observation;urban change detection;modified residual connections;bi-temporal multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite images;UCDNet;urban CD network;deep learning model;multitemporal satellite images","","1","","55","IEEE","23 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These processes transform the landscape of several spatial and temporal scales. In this context, over the past few years, the evaluation of changes in cultivated areas has become one of the major priorities; it makes it possible to develop action plans and to propose management approaches that lead to sustainable agricultural development.Therefore, the use of remote sensing techniques and Landsat multispectral data for the diachronic mapping of agricultural land is a necessity. This work highlights the considerable contribution to the application of spectral indices of chlorophyll in the delimitation of cultivated areas and the analysis of their changes. In this work, we applied two spectral indices, on the one hand, the RECl index (Red-Edge Chlorophyll Vegetation Index) which shows the photosynthetic activity of the plant cover and, on the other hand, the GCI index (Green Chlorophyll Vegetation Index) Index which estimates the chlorophyll content of the leaves of various plant species and detects the physiological state of vegetation. These applications allow the evaluation of the state of vegetation growth and the monitoring of ecological changes in the environment of agricultural areas.The comparison between the results of the two indices shows that the GCI index is very effective in terms of automatic extraction of agricultural areas and discriminates between plant formations compared to the RECI index which includes all formations with important chlorophyll activity (agriculture, forest and natural vegetation).The analysis of the time series (1989, 2011, and 2021) globally confirms a trend of stability of the cultivated areas between ""1989 to 2011"" and a trend of improvement at the regional scale between ""2011 to 2021"" as a result of the improvement in rainfall conditions from 2011 and the application of effective action programs carried out by the state for the improvement of the agricultural sector.However, diachronic analyzes by the GCI index revealed significant increases in agricultural areas between 2011 and 2021 corresponding to 58% and stability between 1989 and 2011 with an increase of 0.17%. On the other hand, plant biomass grew by 22% between 1989 and 2011 and between 2011 and 2021 an increase of 7.25%.","","978-1-6654-8042-0","10.1109/ISPA54004.2022.9786326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9786326","spectral index;vegetation chlorophyll;RECI;GCI;Landsat image;mutation of cultivated areas","Plants (biology);Stability criteria;Time series analysis;Vegetation mapping;Transforms;Market research;Biomass","agriculture;ecology;geophysical image processing;rain;remote sensing;time series;vegetation;vegetation mapping","spectral indices;multitemporal mutations;cultivated land;Mostaganem plateau;agricultural vocation;profound changes;land use;biophysical processes;spatial scales;temporal scales;cultivated areas;sustainable agricultural development;remote sensing techniques;Landsat multispectral data;agricultural land;considerable contribution;RECl index;Red-Edge Chlorophyll Vegetation Index;GCI index Index;Green Chlorophyll Vegetation Index;chlorophyll content;vegetation growth;ecological changes;agricultural areas;RECI index;important chlorophyll activity;forest;natural vegetation;agricultural sector","","1","","6","IEEE","3 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different from the conventional denoising algorithm, the proposed method employs the features of similar reference images from the different band, different sensors, or from multi-temporal images when denoising a target image. The noise-free reference images as a prior is introduced into the denoising object function. The prior's information about the reference image is explored in two aspects: dictionary learning and edge-feature prediction. For dictionary learning, we improve the basis training process by incremental singular value decomposition. For edge-feature prediction, we construct the relationship between gradients of the target image and the reference image by linear ridge regression. The new denoising object function employs both the sparsity of the coefficient and the edge similarity between the target image and the reference image. We also present the optimization scheme for the proposed denoising model. Some typical cases based on different feature relations between a target image and a reference image are comprehensively discussed. Reasonably utilizing the similarity between the target image and the reference image, the proposed algorithm smooths out more noise and conserves more detail at the same time.

The results indicated that the coast changes mainly happened at the northern and eastern parts of the island. The artificial coast came up to 46.4 km with an increment about 8.8 km due to sea reclamation while the mudflat coast decreased about 18.1 km and faded away from 1999 to 2006. Then there was another increase of artificial coast due to returning ponds back to sea, and the sand coast also increased due to sand supply project from 2006 to 2013.

The total coastline decreased from 66.4 km to 57.0 km first but then increased back to 65.5 km during the whole period while the island area had a persistent growth from 128.5 km2 to 140.0 km2. The coastlines moved northward and seaward with less curves due to local constructions except the parts returning ponds back to sea.

While hyperspectral exploratory sensors are demonstrating their potential, satellite remote sensing has simultaneously entered a new era. Multispectral sensors with short revisiting period are now acquiring free, open, global and systematic high resolution visible and infrared imagery. More specifically, Sentinel-2 sensors broke down the barrier between hyper- and multispectral imaging. This sensor optimizes its number of potential applications thanks to numerous narrow bands spanning on a significant range of the spectrum at a high spatial resolution. The recent release of this high performance multispectral instrument calls thus the relevance of hyperspectral spaceborne imaging of medium spatial resolution into question and suggests potential synergies between those two kinds of data. In order to clarify this concern, we tried to identify through a comprehensive review the current and future applications for hyperspectral sensors in the Sentinel-2 context. This study therefore reviews 20 years of researches and applications in satellite hyperspectral remote sensing through the analysis of Earth observation (EO) hyperspectral sensors' publications that cover the Sentinel-2 spectrum range: Hyperion, TianGong-1, PRISMA, HYSI, EnMAP, HISUI, Shalom and HyspIRI. More specifically, this study (i) identifies the most useful wavelengths that are not available on Sentinel-2 and (ii) assesses the assets and the limitations of hyperspectral spaceborne sensors for operational EO. Applications using Sentinel-2 are still uncovered, including some demonstrations made with hyperspectral systems. However, the medium spatial resolution and the long revisit time of hyperspectral sensors, and the low signal-to-noise ratio in the short-wave infrared of Hyperion were highlighted as major limitations for hyperspectral applications compared to the Sentinel-2 system. Forthcoming hyperspectral sensors will probably overcome these constraints. This study is putting forward the compatibility of hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 systems for resolution enhancement techniques, and thus for increasing even more the panel of hyperspectral uses, but also the promising future of hyperspectral remote sensing.","","978-1-5386-3327-4","10.1109/Multi-Temp.2017.8035244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8035244","hyperspectral imaging;hyperspectral applications;Hyperion;EnMAP;HISUI;PRISMA;TianGong-1;Shalom;HyspIRI;Sentinel-2;Earth observation;multi-temporal data","Hyperspectral imaging;Spatial resolution;Sensors;Vegetation mapping;Signal to noise ratio","geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;infrared imaging;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar","hyperspectral Earth observation application;hyperspectral exploratory sensor;systematic high resolution visible imagery;systematic high resolution infrared imagery;Sentinel-2 sensor;hyperspectral spaceborne imaging;hyperspectral Earth observation remote sensing technique;systematic high resolution visible imagery;systematic high infrared imagery resolution;multispectral sensor;multispectral imaging;multispectral instrument;satellite hyperspectral remote sensing;Earth observation hyperspectral sensor;Sentinel-2 spectrum range;hyperspectral spaceborne sensor;HISUI;EnMAP;HYSI;PRISMA;TianGong-1;HyspIRI;signal-to-noise ratio;hyperspectral remote sensing","","2","","106","IEEE","14 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Change detection by sparse unmixing using spectral libraries, with respect to regular spectral unmixing, has the added benefits of circumventing the process of endmember extraction and providing specific mission-based information. However, sparse unmixing is generally a severely ill-conditioned and time-consuming problem. Recently, an approach that aims to identify a subset of signatures of the spectral library that contribute most to the observed data has been proposed in order to improve the conditioning of the problem, hence decreasing computation time and enhancing performance.

Multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations enable us to provide dramatic changes over a very wide swath of the glacier. Although differential radar interferometry (DInSAR) can estimate very accurate glacier movement, it is often suffered from a loss of coherence due to significant temporal and volume decorrelation. Hence, we used intensity offset tracking, which is capable to apply even if the displacement is large, using estimation of the displacement between the two adjacent areas determined by the cross-correlation of the amplitude between two SAR images. In this study, ice velocity of Narssap sermia was observed by using TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X X-band SAR images. We acquired 39 images which were collected in the stripmap mode at ascending direction, VV polarization, and incidence angle of 21.4 degree.

Based on the wide range and real time data, remote sensing was widely employed in drought monitoring. Many researchers have proposed a series of drought monitoring methods based on MODIS data over the past few decades. The AquaCrop model was released by FAO, which is suitable for crop growth monitoring in arid area with its simple interface, less input parameters and good simulation effect. AquaCrop model was applied to the researches on climate change, irrigation strategy, planting management and so on. Many scholars have verified the efficiency of AquaCrop model in arid areas of China. Since AquaCrop model is driven by water, it is reasonable to use it to monitor and reflect the drought process. This study was based on Terra-MODIS data products and agro-meteorological data during the year of 2007-2008, 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 of Winter Wheat growth periods in Henan Province. In this study, firstly, localizing the AquaCrop by the simulated and observed Canopy Cover (CC), Biomass (B), Yield (Y) and 0-50cm Soil Water Content (SWC). The values between observed and simulated have good consistency, with R2 = 0.9289 of CC, R2 =0.9418 of B, R2 = 0.8309 of SWC. Meanwhile, the simulation results of four growth stages of winter wheat show that the model has good applicability and stability in Henan Province. Secondly, calculating TVDI using MODIS data in the same time range. Finally, analyzing the correlation between the results of two models and observed soil water content in different depth of soil layers. Similarly, the simulation accuracy of two models are better with shallow soil moisture. MODIS TVDI has a highest correlation with 30cm soil water content (r= -0.344), while AquaCrop model with 10cm (r=0.819). The research can provide important reference for drought monitoring of winter wheat and it is helpful for effective agriculture drought monitoring and decision-making.","","978-1-7281-2116-1","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820686","AquaCrop model;Drought monitoring;MODIS TVDI","Climate change;Agriculture;Environmental monitoring;Irrigation;Water resources;Crops","agriculture;crops;hydrological techniques;irrigation;moisture;soil;vegetation mapping","Winter Wheat drought monitoring;multitemporal MODIS data;Henan Province;drought monitoring methods;crop growth monitoring;drought process;Terra-MODIS data products;agro-meteorological data;soil water content;AquaCrop model;winter wheat growth periods;agriculture drought monitoring","","","","23","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are still technical bottlenecks such as poor spatial resolution, low precision and the lack of imagery in the application of remote sensing research in the spatial and temporal distribution of the cropping system. In this study, a more accurate remote sensing monitoring method for the regional cropping system was proposed. The imagery with wide field of view (WFV) of multi-temporal GF-1 satellite was used to construct a temporal extraction model of the cropping system, which was based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Using the method proposed in this paper, remote sensing monitoring of the main farming system in Suqian City, Jiangsu Province was carried out, which could provide reference for the extraction of the crop system in southern cloud and rain regions. The results showed that the whole crop development period of the main planting system (rice-winter wheat and winter wheat-summer maize) in the study area was covered by selecting the high time density GF-1/WFV with 16 m resolution remote sensing imagery acquired from 2016 to 2017 as the data sources, and the complementarity of the multi-temporal imagery avoided the imagery loss caused by the cloudy climate in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China. By building a mask and marking the “polluted” areas of the cloud, the interference of cloud imagery on crop information extraction was reduced effectively. In addition, the decision condition was optimized several times by the human-computer interaction, and the key parameter was determined to ensure the accuracy of the temporal extraction model. According to the result of monitoring the major cropping system in Suqian City, the overall classification accuracy was 93.56%, Kappa coefficient was 0.85 and the relative margin of error for individual crops was 7.53%, which met the accuracy requirements for application of agricultural achievements. These results showed that, in comparison with previous remote sensing methods, the method proposed in this study can monitor the regional main crop planting system accurately and can be used to monitor the cropping system based on the high-resolution imagery in multiple ripening areas. In this way, this approach will provide theoretical basis and technical support for the development of the precision agriculture, the optimization of regional cropping patterns and the efficient utilization of agricultural resources.","","978-1-5386-5038-7","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2018.8476108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8476108","GF-1/WFV imagery;NDVI;cropping system;condition monitoring","Agriculture;Monitoring;Remote sensing;Urban areas;Clouds;Satellites;Time series analysis","agriculture;crops;geophysical image processing;rain;remote sensing;resource allocation;vegetation;vegetation mapping","regional cropping system;temporal extraction model;GF-1/WFV imagery;regional agricultural resource allocation;crop layout;accurate remote sensing monitoring method;multitemporal GF-1 satellite;main farming system;crop system;crop development period;main planting system;high time density GF-1/WFV;16 m resolution remote sensing imagery;multitemporal imagery;crop information extraction;regional main crop planting system accurately;regional cropping patterns;time 2017.0 as;size 16.0 m","","","","18","IEEE","30 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A main challenge is then to design methods able to leverage the complementarity between the temporal dynamics and the spatial patterns that characterize these data structures. Focusing on land cover classification (or mapping) tasks, the majority of approaches dealing with SITS data only considers the temporal dimension, while the integration of the spatial context is frequently neglected. In this work, we propose an attentive spatial temporal graph convolutional neural network that exploits both spatial and temporal dimensions in SITS. Despite the fact that this neural network model is well suited to deal with spatio-temporal information, this is the first work that considers it for the analysis of SITS data. Experiments are conducted on two study areas characterized by different land cover landscapes and real-world operational constraints (i.e., limited labeled data due to acquisition costs). The results show that our model consistently outperforms all the competing methods obtaining a performance gain, in terms of F-Measure, of at least 5 points with respect to the best competing approaches on both benchmarks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3055554","French National Research Agency through the Investments for the Future Program(grant numbers:ANR-16-CONV-0004 (DigitAg)); GEOSUD Project(grant numbers:ANR-10-EQPX-20); French Ministry of agriculture Agricultural and Rural Development Trust Account; PARCELLE Project funded by the French Space Agency(grant numbers:DAR CNES 2019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9340250","Spatial temporal graph convolutional neural network;attention-based neural network;object-based image classification;satellite image time series;land cover classification;deep learning","Time series analysis;Task analysis;Satellites;Image segmentation;Data models;Earth;Convolutional neural networks","geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;neural nets;remote sensing;terrain mapping;time series","spatial temporal graph CNN;land cover mapping;multitemporal remote sensing data;satellite image time series;modern Earth Observation systems;Earth surface dynamics;temporal dynamics;spatial patterns;data structures;land cover classification;SITS data;temporal dimension;spatial context;attentive spatial temporal graph convolutional neural network;spatial dimensions;temporal dimensions;neural network model;spatio-temporal information;limited labeled data;land cover landscapes","","7","","36","CCBY","29 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The existing approaches commonly used for this task can present serious drawbacks, such as the possibility to derive invalid trajectories, use of complex data inputs, and several classification steps. To provide a simple method for land cover trajectory classification, we present a novel algorithm named Compound Maximum a Posteriori (CMAP) classifier. CMAP incorporates the knowledge of land cover dynamics and the information of multi-temporal data sets to produce only valid land cover trajectories using a global generative classification approach and simple inputs. CMAP was tested in two case studies, in which we compared land cover trajectories obtained by CMAP to those obtained using the traditional Maximum Likelihood (ML) classifier in a post-classification comparison approach. In the first case study, we classified 6 images from the same sensor, using the same land cover legend. In the second case study, we classified 3 images from different types of sensors, using different land cover legend levels. Because of its formulation, CMAP does not return invalid transitions/trajectories as classification results. The use of ML and post-classification comparison, on the other hand, resulted in invalid land cover trajectories in more than 50% of the used images in both case studies. Furthermore, the use of CMAP leads to better accuracy indexes for land cover classification of each date and reduces the classification noise.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2997019","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq)(grant numbers:#401528/2012-0,#309135/2015-0); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9099235","Classification algorithms;land cover trajectory mapping;multi-temporal classification;remote sensing;remote monitoring","Trajectory;Mathematical model;Compounds;Remote sensing;Time series analysis;Earth;Heuristic algorithms","geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;image classification;land cover;remote sensing","valid land cover trajectories;global generative classification approach;CMAP;traditional Maximum Likelihood classifier;post-classification comparison approach;invalid land cover trajectories;classification noise;land cover trajectory classification;Posteriori approach;remote sensing time-series;classification steps;Posteriori classifier;land cover dynamics;complex data inputs;compound maximum a posteriori classifier;land cover legend levels","","1","","30","CCBY","25 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To overcome this problem, we propose a new method to detect stable features by intersecting Coherent Scatters (CS) and SAR-FAST corners. Thus the stable features are not only corners but also located at the time-invariant area. Then, the stable features are described by SIFT descriptors and the coarse registration is achieved by matching these stable points.

In Turkey, wheat production is very important, and it is widely planted in Anatolia and in Southeastern Turkey. In this study, four different classification types were evaluated for wheat determination. As a study area, the region of Islahiye and Nurdagi counties of Gaziantep, Turkey was chosen. As satellite data, a Landsat 8 OLI image acquired on April 10, 2017 was used. The ground-truth points that were collected in surveying, and additionally field information taken from farmer registration system provided by local administrations were used as references. The application was done by classification of the satellite image using four different methods (Maximum Likelihood, Support Vector Machine, Condition-Based and Nearest Neighbor). After the results were obtained, the wheat classes obtained were transformed to vector format to overlay on the satellite image for visual analysis. The area of wheat class obtained from each method was presented and compared. The results were also evaluated by comparing with the data taken from Turkish Statistical Institute. All of the methods provided results close to the Turkish Statistical Institute records. Even the results were not significantly different from each other, wheat area determined using Support Vector Machine classification was better than others. The accuracy assessments were performed by calculating the total accuracy and KAPPA/KIA coefficient. The accuracy assessment analysis showed that the three supervised methods were better than the unsupervised one. As a future study, evaluation of these four classification methods using a multi-temporal dataset is planned.","","978-1-7281-2116-1","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820623","wheat;Landsat 8 OLI;SVM;maximum likelihood;object-based","Agriculture;Remote sensing;Satellites;Support vector machine classification;Image segmentation;Estimation","crops;geophysical image processing;image classification;vegetation mapping","satellite image;wheat class;Turkish Statistical Institute records;wheat area;Support Vector Machine classification;accuracy assessment analysis;supervised methods;classification methods;regional classification;winter wheat;remote sensing data;Southeastern Turkey;crop acreage estimation;agricultural management;wheat production;different classification types;wheat determination;satellite data;Landsat 8 OLI image;ground-truth points;field information;farmer registration system;local administrations;Maximum Likelihood;AD 2017 04 10;Islahiye county;Nurdagi county;Gaziantep;condition-based neighbor;nearest neighbor;visual analysis;KAPPA/KIA coefficient;multitemporal dataset","","","","15","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to eliminate the scattering influence of vegetation effectively, this paper developed a modified vegetation backscattering model to retrieve vegetation-covered soil moisture based on multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 data and field measurements. This model combined the advantages of optical and radar methods by considering scattering contributions of underlying bare soil and vegetation canopy. Vegetation coverage was used to separate the scattering mechanism of the vegetation from bare soil component in a pixel. In addition, advanced integral equation method was presented to define the scattering of underlying bare soil. PROSAIL optical model was applied to calculate crown water content, which is an important variable associated with the scattering of vegetation canopy. Results demonstrated that the modified model on March 29, 2014 performed better in soil moisture retrieval than that at other growth stages with R2 of 0.806 and root-mean-square error of 0.043 m3·m-3, respectively. Soil moisture can be effectively retrieved by using the modified model in an agricultural region where the surface type is ranging from relatively sparse to full cover.

The normalized difference of intensity correlation coefficient (NDIC), normalized difference of interferometric coherence coefficient (NDCC), co-seismic intensity correlation (IC) and difference in the backscattering coefficient (DBC) images were used in order to create damage maps. In this investigation, histogram of damaged and intact building in the values of NDIC, NDCC and statistical distribution of IC-DBC were analyzed with different window size of correlation coefficients r and local mean values m. It was found that damaged buildings are better detectable with NDIC and NDCC variables than IC-DBC. Artifical neural network (ANN) supervised classification method has better results of producer's accuracy for damaged building classes. Producer's accuracy of damaged building class is achieved 95.6%, however, there are misclassification between intact building and none built-up area, it is decreased by using GIS data having mask of built-up area.

With this approach, the size of the tiles is not set a priori but, rather, tiles of variable size are sought so that the distribution functions attributed to classes of interest can be parameterized in a robust way. The InSAR coherence makes it possible to discriminate false alarms caused by other land cover classes that also show high backscattering values but are not coherent in time (e.g. certain types of vegetated areas). Both intensity and coherence features are obtained by averaging multi-temporal SAR series allowing thus to reduce the speckle without losing spatial resolution.

In the present study, landscape spatial metrics were investigated to assess changes of multitemporal vegetation cover within the Tlemcen National Park (TNP) in Northwest of Algeria over 31 years. To achieve this, five landscape metrics including number of patches (NP), landscape shape index (LSI), class area (CA), largest patch index (LPI), and percentage of landscape (PLAND) were applied and analysed to assess the fragmentation at class level. While, only NP and LSI were analyzed at the landscape level. Three Landsat images acquired during September 1987, 1999 and 2018 with TM, ETM+ and OLI sensors, respectively, were used. After rigorous preprocessing steps, the images were transformed and threshold into NDVI maps representing the major land use classes in TNP, such as forest, shrub lands, open shrub, scattered vegetation and bare soil. For validation purposes, Kappa coefficient analysis was carried out based on 120 ground control points representing these land use classes. The obtained results revealed that the generated confusion matrix ($\mathrm{p} < 0.05$) yield a Kappa coefficient of 0.77 and a significant concordance coefficient of 0.83 between the observed (ground truth) and predicted classes by NDVI-2018. These results indicate that the thresholding procedure is very appropriate and extendable to the other NDVI maps derived for the years 1987 and 1999. Moreover, at the landscape level, the NP and LSI metrics have increased over time by 67.6% in 1999 and 27.9% in 2018, revealing a gradual and important fragmentation of the landscape at TNP. In addition, this trend is corroborated at the class level by the five considered metrics. Accordingly, the synergy between metric indices and remote sensing data offers great potential for sustainable and efficient management policies to address the issues of spatiotemporal fragmentation and degradation across national parks.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553177","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9553177","Vegetation cover;change detection;Landsat data;serial NDVI;inter-calibration;landscape metrics;fragmentation","Measurement;Degradation;Vegetation mapping;Forestry;Soil;Large scale integration;Spatiotemporal phenomena","geophysical image processing;geophysical signal processing;image classification;soil;terrain mapping;vegetation;vegetation mapping","multitemporal changes analysis;natural vegetation cover;serial NDVI;Tlemcen National Park;vegetation cover fragmentation;sustainable development;land ecosystems;landscape spatial metrics;multitemporal vegetation cover;landscape metrics;patch index;class level;landscape level;Landsat images;NDVI maps;shrub lands;scattered vegetation;Kappa coefficient analysis;ground control points;concordance coefficient;NDVI-2018;spatiotemporal fragmentation;national parks;bare soil","","","","13","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the drawbacks of subjectivity and delay reduce the conviction of the analysis results. In this paper, we leverage the objectivity and real-time features of remote sensing (RS) images to analyze the effects of the B&R project. Our research takes Voi town along the Mongolia-Nairobi Railway as the representative city. In addition, in order to prove the causal relationship between the B&R and economic development, we select the Taveta town as the comparison city. The semantic segmentation based on deep learning is applied to the multi-temporal RS images, to retrieve the economic development by automatically recognizing houses. On this basis, the construction and development of both the studied region and the comparison are quantitatively analyzed by meshing analysis and standard deviation elliptic methods. For overcoming the shortages of the conventional algorithms, a novel segmentation network based on the attention mechanism is proposed.

The results show that it is possible to map the coverage of the Pinus radiata class up to an accuracy of R2 ~ 0.6 and RMSE of ~10 %. Generally, a higher number of Sentinel-2 images increased the performance of the model, while there was no significant dependency on a specific acquisition date. However, the variability of the results is high, which indicates that a careful selection of multi-temporal endmembers is crucial to a successful unmixing of Pinus radiata.","","978-1-5386-3327-4","10.1109/Multi-Temp.2017.8035216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8035216","Pinus radiata;linear unmixing;NNLS;time-series;Maule region;Nothofagus","Remote sensing;Satellites;Earth;Vegetation mapping;Support vector machines;Vegetation;Classification algorithms","geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image segmentation;land cover;least squares approximations;phenology;terrain mapping;time series;vegetation;vegetation mapping","Sentinel-2 time-series;Pinus radiata invasions;Monterey Pine;Southern Beeches;endemic Nothofagus forests;Maule region;central Chile;cloud free images;phenological cycle;Sentinel-2 scenes;least square algorithm;land-cover components;SVM classification;UAV-based hyperspectral mosaics;specific acquisition date;multi-temporal endmembers;invasive species","","4","","12","IEEE","14 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accurate information over burned areas (BA) is essential for the assessment and restoration of economic and ecological losses. However, the feature representation of BA is often complicated. Meanwhile, since the spectral similarity among land cover categories, changes of background information have a greater impact. In addition, there are very few publicly available forest fire datasets. To solve the above problems, an unsupervised knowledge-guided symmetric deep network (UKSD-Net) is proposed for BA detection, where multi-index combination is utilized to incorporate the prior knowledge. The background changes are suppressed with the combination of symmetric deep network and Slow Feature Analysis (SFA). More reliable pseudo samples generated by uncertainty analysis are used to improve the final performance. Besides, we construct two forest fire datasets.

Using a foreshortening mask is a suitable solution, but finding the mask is challenging. The aim of this research is to exploit the fusion of Sentinel-1 multi-temporal images and SRTM DEM to produce a quasi-global foreshortening mask using the Google Earth Engine (GEE), cloud-based platform. The mean value of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 images is calculated. Then a local minimum algorithm finds probable foreshortening area.

Snow cover extent monitoring has been one such application where microwave sensors have been a popular choice due to their sensitivity toward the dielectric property. Snow is a dynamic matter since its dielectric state is dependent on climatic factors prevailing locally around it. In the literature, the polarization fraction (PF) has been used for landcover characterization. In this paper, we utilize the seasonal variation of the PF for mapping snow cover over the Himalayan terrain. Temporal variation of the strength in the polarized return due to change in landcover and season is the prime motivation behind this approach. In addition, the effect of SAR data acquisition time on mapping algorithms is considered in this work which is seldom discussed in the literature. Furthermore, a study is conducted to analyze the seasonal variation in the entropy ($H$) and the scattering type ( $\alpha$) parameters over the bare snow-covered ground and the forested areas. The seasonal response of the terrain in the $H/\alpha$ plane corresponding to specific scattering characteristics is analyzed. The applicability of the approach is tested with RADARSAT-2 (FQ28) C-band full polarimetric image pairs over the Manali-Dhundi region, Himachal Pradesh, India, located in the western Hindu-Kush Himalayas.

In the acquired products, clouds form opaque objects are obscuring parts of the scene and preventing a reliable extraction of information from these areas. Consequently, cloud shadows create similar problems, as the reflected intensity of the shadowed areas is highly reduced, generating additional info gaps. The problem can be handled by replacing clouds/shadows pixels from other close-date acquisitions, but that would assume a prior knowledge of the spatial distribution of clouds and their corresponding shadows in a scene. This research introduces a method that provides the clouds/shadows layers and their percentage in LS (TM & ETM+) and CBERS (HRCC) scenes. The approach relies on a set of literature indicators to create a composite image that enhances the visual differentiation of clouds/shadows from other objects. The created composite RGB are then warped to a relative luminance raster calculated from the linear bands components. Afterwards, the raster is processed by a K-means unsupervised classifier with a definite number of classes in order to isolate the target-layer pixels. Next, the statistical mode for the population of each class is calculated, compared and used to select the cloud/shadow class automatically, and finally the results are refined by a set of morphological filters. The processing chain avoids the usage of thresholds and highly reduces the user intervention. The achieved outcomes on various test cases are promising and stable, and encourage further developments.","2153-7003","978-1-4799-7929-5","10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7326851","Cloud extraction;CBERS HRCC data;LANDSAT data;multi-temporal acquisitions","Clouds;Remote sensing;Satellites;Earth;Accuracy;Data mining;Cloud computing","clouds;geophysical techniques;land cover","CBERS-2 CCD data;LANDSAT data;land cover dynamics;reflected intensity;shadowed areas;close-date acquisitions;composite image;visual differentiation;linear band components;K-means unsupervised classifier;target-layer pixels;statistical mode;morphological filters;Automatic clouds-shadows extraction method","","2","","15","IEEE","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accurate and timely acquisition of information on dryland crop types, planting areas and spatial distribution in dryland can provide an important basis for agricultural production and management, as well as the formulation of national food policy and economic plan, therefore, it is of great significance for promoting structural reform of agricultural supply side and national food security. The key stage of crop growth in the north of China is affected by cloud and rain weather, which makes it difficult to obtain sufficient effective optical data, and the current recognition accuracy of dryland crops based on polarized SAR data is low. In order to solve these problems, this study selected Jizhou City, Hebei Province as the research area, using the full-polarization RADARSAT -2 data of July 17, August 7 and September 24, 2018, and then selected three polarization decomposition methods (Cloude-Pottier decomposition, Freeman decomposition and Yamaguchi decomposition) and two classification methods (maximum likelihood and random forest) to construct 18 classification combinations. The identification of corn and cotton in study area was studied by using various schemes. Finally, the accuracy of dry land crop identification under various combination schemes was compared quantitatively with the ground survey data. The results showed that, Yamaguchi decomposition combined with maximum likelihood classification method was used on August 7 (flowering and boll period of cotton), and the classification accuracy was the highest (production accuracy was 78.98%). For corn, Yamaguchi decomposition combined with random forest classification method was used on September 24 (mature period of corn), and the classification accuracy was the highest (production accuracy was over 90%). I For the decomposition method, Yamaguchi decomposition has the highest classification accuracy among the three decomposition methods, followed by Freeman decomposition, Cloude-Pottier decomposition has the lowest classification accuracy; as far as the classification method is concerned, the maximum likelihood classification method has the highest recognition accuracy for cotton, but the random forest classification has the highest recognition accuracy for corn; in terms of the best identification phase, the flowering and boll period is the best recognition period for cotton, and the maturity period is the best recognition time for corn.. This study will help to improve the recognition accuracy of corn and cotton in fully polarized SAR data, and provide reference for the identification of multi-temporal dryland crops under complex planting structures.","","978-1-7281-2116-1","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820662","dryland crop identification;polarization decomposition;multitemporal","Scattering;Cotton;Covariance matrices;Clouds;Urban areas;Monitoring","agriculture;crops;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;vegetation mapping","dryland crop recognition;multitemporal polarization SAR data;planting area;wide spatial distribution;grain production;dryland crop types;agricultural production;national food policy;economic plan;national food security;crop growth;cloud;rain weather;sufficient effective optical data;current recognition accuracy;polarization decomposition methods;Cloude-Pottier decomposition;Freeman decomposition;Yamaguchi decomposition;corn;cotton;dry land crop identification;ground survey data;maximum likelihood classification method;production accuracy;random forest classification method;mature period;decomposition method;recognition period;maturity period;recognition time;fully polarized SAR data;multitemporal dryland crops;complex planting structures;classification accuracy;recognition accuracy;classification combinations;full-polarization RADARSAT-2 data","","1","","15","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To improve image registration in remote sensing, this paper develops a robust and accurate feature point matching framework. A modified scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) method is first introduced for feature detection and pair matching. Based on the properties of matched pairs, the standard grouping boundary (SGB) and confidence elliptical boundary (CEB) are computed for further examination. The SGB is utilized to categorize matched pairs according to the pair slopes. The CEB is further employed to remove outliers whose feature positions are outside the elliptical contour. Finally, the random sample consensus (RANSAC) approach is implemented to acquire the most appropriate transformation function for image registration. The proposed image registration algorithm has been tested on numerous multi-temporal remote sensing images. Experimental results validated the improvement in feature matching accuracy, which resulted in better registration performance over state-of-the-art methods. This new framework is of potential in many remote sensing applications that require automatic image registration.","","978-1-5386-2839-3","10.1109/DICTA.2017.8227403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8227403","","Image registration;Remote sensing;Feature extraction;Dogs;Robustness;Detectors","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image matching;image registration;remote sensing;transforms","accurate feature point matching algorithm;robust feature point matching framework;feature detection;pair matching;SGB;confidence elliptical boundary;CEB;pair slopes;automatic remote sensing image registration;random sample consensus approach;standard grouping boundary;modified scale-invariant feature transform method","","4","","21","IEEE","21 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The validation of detected changes is challenging partially because the validation data are often not readily available. Unlike multi-temporal change analysis, time series analysis not only detects areas of change but also reports time of change. Both spatial and temporal accuracy are therefore important for the accuracy assessment. Ayuquila River Basin (ARB) is one of the early action areas in Mexico for the implementation of REDD + initiatives under UNFCCC. In ARB, shifting cultivation and cattle grazing often take place, resulting in degraded forestland. Sub-annual forest disturbance detection and estimation contribution to the improved local forest management and REDD + implementation. Landsat-based NDVI time series data covering 1999-2018 were analysed using linear regression and the breakpoints of change and the magnitude of change were detected. Breakpoints with magnitude of change ranging from (-0.05) to (-0.2) were verified during a field campaign in October 2018. Here the magnitude of change is related with NDVI differences. Areas with magnitude of change higher than (-0.2) were identified as false changes. Verification data were generated by visually interpreting time series Landsat images of 2016-2018. In this way, areas with forest loss were identified. By stratified random sampling, 683 points were applied for the verification including 511 points of forests and 172 points of forest loss. It yields 75.84% for the overall accuracy of the change detection; for the detected forest loss as a category, the user's accuracy is 88.89% and the producer's accuracy is 0.46%. A possible reason for the very low producer's accuracy is that the selected magnitude value (-0.2) is too low and some of the detected changes were filtered out.","","978-1-7281-4350-7","10.1109/LAGIRS48042.2020.9165583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9165583","Deforestation;Forest degradation;Magnitude of change","Forestry;Time series analysis;Earth;Remote sensing;Artificial satellites;Vegetation mapping;Mathematical model","forestry;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;natural resources;remote sensing;time series;vegetation;vegetation mapping","detected forest loss;change detection;visually interpreting time series Landsat images;verification data;false changes;Landsat-based NDVI time series data;improved local forest management;sub-annual forest disturbance detection;early action areas;Ayuquila River Basin;temporal accuracy;spatial accuracy;time series analysis;multitemporal change analysis;Mexico;ayuquila River Basin;detected changes","","1","","17","IEEE","12 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here we present the first comprehensive multi-sensor cumulative deformation map for the dam generated from space-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements from the Italian constellation COSMO-SkyMed and the European Sentinel-1a satellite. We compared 2014-2016 data to an historic dataset spanning 2004-2010 acquired with the Envisat ASAR sensor. We found that deformation was rapid during 2004-2010, slowed down in 2012-2014, and restarted in August 2014 when grouting operations stopped due to the temporary capture of the dam by the self proclaimed Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). We took advantage of the availability of data from multiple SAR satellites to infer the deformation at the dam in great spatial and temporal detail and shed new light on the processes of the ongoing destabilization.

The secondary forests in southeast China are carbon-dense, species-rich ecosystems with high productivity, play a key role in maintaining regional environment and mitigating climate change. In this study, we assessed the capacity of bi-temporal airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to predict forest volume change in a secondary forest of southeast China over a 6-year period. To do so, we evaluated four different approaches for estimating the change in volume, specifically: (1) predicting volume for Time 1 by the model fitted by the field and LiDAR data in Time 2, volume change was then calculated as the difference between the predicted volume from the two times; (2) predicting change using the differences of LiDAR metrics; (3) predicting change as the difference between separate volume predictions; and (4) predicting change using the LiDAR metrics from each point in time. The results demonstrated that, in general, Method 2 and 4 have higher accuracy than Method 1 and 3. Compared with the results of the indirect approach (Method 3) for volume (CV-R2=0.62), the direct approach (Method 2) (CV-R2 = 0.66) has a higher accuracy. Within the volume estimation models, the Δ volume model (R2 = 0.72) using the direct approach explains lower variability in the response variable than volume models in Time 1 and Time 2 (R2 = 0.76-0.80). The canopy height distribution metrics of median height (i.e., h50) and delta value of median height (Δh50) were most often selected by the models.

Monitoring rice field distribution can effectively manage food security. This study proposed a feature-based decision approach to detect the mapping of rice cultivation using the time-series Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data provided by Sentinel-1A. Instead of using the maximum and minimum backscatter of SAR data, as most studies in the literature, this study established a rice growth model based on complete time series data in the rice growth period. From the developed model, a feature related to rice growth time, that is, the time interval (TI) between vegetative growth and maturity stages was introduced. The proposed feature was first compared with the feature of backscatter difference (BD) between the maximum and minimum value of SAR data. The experimental results show that the proposed feature can achieve better rice detection accuracy. Then, a decision method based on the combination of TI and BD features was proposed for rice planting mapping. In the study, Yunlin and Changhua counties in central Taiwan were used as experimental areas. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve more than 90% overall accuracy in rice detection for VH polarization. Furthermore, comparing with the traditional method that uses growth height feature, BD, the proposed method can improve the overall accuracy of rice detection about 5%.","2153-7003","978-1-7281-6374-1","10.1109/IGARSS39084.2020.9323278","National Space Organization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9323278","rice field distribution;Sentinel-1A;Synthetic Aperture Radar;multi-temporal data;rice growth features","Synthetic aperture radar;Feature extraction;Backscatter;Time series analysis;Agriculture;Smoothing methods;Data models","crops;geophysical image processing;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;time series;vegetation","growth height feature;time series SAR data;important food source;monitoring rice field distribution;food security;feature-based decision approach;rice cultivation;time-series Synthetic Aperture Radar data;maximum backscatter;minimum backscatter;rice growth model;complete time series data;rice growth period;rice growth time;vegetative growth;maturity stages;rice detection accuracy;BD features;rice planting mapping;Yunlin and Changhua counties;central Taiwan","","1","","5","IEEE","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Taking into account the availability for free of high resolution (10 to 30 meter) optical and SAR data from different satellite, the most resource consuming task is ground data collecting. That is why the proper time of ground surveys and crop classification maps developing is very important. In the study we propose to build three crop classification maps for JECAM Ukraine test site in Kyiv region during the vegetation season. The first one is built in the middle of May to classify winter cereals and rapeseeds. The next crop classification map is developing in July to discriminate major summer crops (spring cereals, maize, soybeans, sunflowers). The final crop map is built in autumn to refine summer crops and sugar beet discrimination. Time series of multi-temporal satellite images with restored missing (clouded and shadowed) data are classified using neural network approach, in particular ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). It is shown, that addition of satellite data from the end of previous year to the spring imagery allows to significantly improve the accuracy of winter crops classification. In July it is possible to deliver the map with major summer crops with overall accuracy higher than 87%, and the overall accuracy of final map at the end of the season is 94%.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-3332-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730864","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7730864","Early season classification;crop map;neural network;satellite data","Agriculture;Satellites;Remote sensing;Springs;Earth;Optical imaging;Neural networks","agriculture;crops;geophysical image processing;image classification;neural nets;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;time series","season crop classification;time series;optical images;SAR images;neural network classifier;agricultural crop;crop calendar;ground survey;crop classification map;JECAM Ukraine test site;Kyiv region;vegetation season;winter cereal;rapeseed;summer crop;spring cereal;maize;soybean;sunflower;sugar beet discrimination;satellite images;multilayer perceptron","","6","","17","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We formulated the temporal decorrelation model that accounts for the random motion and dielectric changes. By applying the model into the multi-temporal coherence before the event, we extracted the temporal decorrelation components induced by natural phenomena. Based on the extracted parameters, their decorrelation probabilities related to natural changes were estimated in canopy and ground.

We compared probabilities between the natural phenomena and the certain event in order to assign the changed regions.

It is hard to identify targets due to strong background inferences. However, targets often change over time while most background scatterers are temporally stable. With the increasing availability of multi-temporal SAR images, one can separate moving targets from the background by analyzing their temporal behavior. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to remove background clutters by developing a stable background mask. First, we investigate the temporal behavior of amplitude time series (TS) of different scatterers using three typical distributions. Then, temporally stable pixels are extracted to generate a stable background mask for the scene. We block the stable regions for each image in the amplitude TS and obtain the processed images where only unstable regions that may include targets are left. Since most background inferences are eliminated, it will help lower false alarms in the target detection procedure.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-2792-0","10.1109/IGARSS46834.2022.9884143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9884143","SAR target detection;High-cluttered environments;SAR time series;Stable background mask","Time series analysis;Geoscience and remote sensing;Object detection;Radar polarimetry;Inference algorithms;Behavioral sciences;Task analysis","object detection;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;time series","medium-resolution SAR images;strong background inferences;background scatterers;multitemporal SAR images;temporal behavior;background clutters;stable background mask;amplitude time series;different scatterers;temporally stable pixels;stable regions;processed images;target detection procedure;novel background removal method;high-cluttered environments;SAR time series;SAR target detection","","","","8","IEEE","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, a cloud, cloud shadow, and snow detection algorithm called Fmask is used for eliminating “noisy” observations. Then, a time series model that has components of overall, seasonality and trend are estimated for each pixel of each spectral band. The model is capable of predicting surface reflectance for pixels at any location and any date assuming persistence of land cover. The algorithm was applied to one Landsat 8 scene in North China (WRS Path 123 and Row 32). All available (a total of 63) Landsat 8 images acquired between 2014 and 2016 in Google Earth Engine were used. Three clearest scenes were used for quality assessment of the predicted surface reflectance. The average R2 of 6 bands were 0.75, 0.69 and 0.67 for 04/13/2014, 09/04/2014 and 10/06/2014 scene, respectively. The average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6 bands were 0.025, 0.026 and 0.028 for 04/13/2014, 09/04/2014 and 10/06/2014 scene, respectively. The results demonstrate that the predicted images are in good agreement with the real images. In addition, the performance of TSH model for cloud-gap fill was assessed and was compared with Best-Available-Pixel (BAP) composite method. The MODIS Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance product (MCD43A4) was used to assess the error of cloud-gap fill. For the three selected cloud-covered test regions, the average R2/ RMSE were 0.8/0.022, 0.63/0.014 and 0.8/0.018 for TSH model, and were 0.72/0.026, 0.53/0.016 and 0.66/0.032 for BAP composite method. The results conclude that prediction accuracy of TSH model is superior to that of BAP composite method. The TSH model-derived cloud-free images are of great importance for multi-temporal land-cover classification and change detection.","","978-1-7281-4615-7","10.1109/Multi-Temp.2019.8866940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8866940","surface reflectance;time series harmonic model;Landsat;Google Earth Engine;BAP;cloud-gap fill","Earth;Clouds;Remote sensing;Artificial satellites;Reflectivity;Predictive models;Time series analysis","clouds;geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;mean square error methods;remote sensing;snow;time series","TSH model-derived cloud-free images;time series harmonic model;Landsat 8 images;cloud shadow;snow detection algorithm;time series model;spectral band;Landsat 8 scene;surface reflectance;root mean square error;cloud-gap fill;Best-Available-Pixel composite method;MODIS Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance product;BAP composite method;cloud-covered test regions","","","","14","IEEE","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although deep learning-based CD methods work well for their excellent modeling ability, objects in different size and shape are generally processed by the same filter kernels in feature extraction, which leads to spatial blurring and degrades the CD performance. In this paper, a spatial adaptive and feature enhanced (SAFE) siamese network is proposed to tackle this problem, where the SAFE consists of a spatial-adaptive (SA) part and a feature-enhanced (FE) part. Specifically, pixel belonging to different objects possesses its own spatial knowledge, which is captured by a soft fusion of multi-scale difference images (DIs) called SA part. Changed and unchanged areas are strengthened or weakened by the FE, which combines object features with each DI accordingly. Moreover, since there are more unchanged pixels than changed pixels, a weight-pair is introduced to balance changed and unchanged objects in the training process. The experimental results verify that compared with four representative CD algorithms, our proposed method performs best on the Change Detection Dataset (CDD).","2153-7003","978-1-6654-2792-0","10.1109/IGARSS46834.2022.9883390","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9883390","Change detection (CD);spatial-adaptive (SA);feature-enhanced (FE)","Training;Earth;Shape;Filtering;Geoscience and remote sensing;Feature extraction;Iron","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image resolution;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;remote sensing","feature-enhanced siamese network;earth observation;surface changes;multitemporal images;deep learning-based CD methods;excellent modeling ability;filter kernels;feature extraction;spatial blurring;CD performance;spatial adaptive;feature enhanced siamese network;SAFE;spatial-adaptive part;feature-enhanced part;spatial knowledge;multiscale difference images;SA part;changed areas;unchanged areas;object features;unchanged pixels;changed pixels;unchanged objects;representative CD algorithms;Change Detection Dataset","","","","12","IEEE","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, this paper proposes a multi-temporal ultra-dense memory (MTUDM) network for video super-resolution. Particularly, we embed convolutional long-short-term memory (ConvLSTM) into ultra-dense residual block (UDRB) to construct an ultra-dense memory block (UDMB) for extracting and retaining spatio-temporal correlations. This design also reduces the layer depth by expanding the width, thus avoiding training difficulties, such as gradient exploding and vanishing under a large model. We further adopt multi-temporal information fusion (MTIF) strategy to merge the extracted temporal feature maps in consecutive frames, improving the accuracy without requiring much extra computational cost.

This study aims to determine the spatial and temporal evolution of dense rainforests using remote sensing data. Many previous studies have attempted to determine the area of forest cover in Côte d'Ivoire ([2], [3], [4], [5], [6] and [7]). Most of these studies were conducted from either aerial photographs or satellite images of low spatial resolutions such as NOAA / AVHRR [8]. However, through these studies, methods of estimates of the area of forest cover generally vary from one author to another, thus causing an inconsistency in the results [9]. Remote sensing allows a better assessment of the scope and scale of the problem of deforestation. Using multi-temporal data, one can better detect and analyze changes in the forest cover. By comparing images of previous years with recent scenes, it becomes possible to effectively measure the differences in the extent of deforestation and loss of rainforests in Côte d'Ivoire ([10] and [11]). In a first phase, the country's dense forest cover of the 1960s was determined from the digitization of existing vegetation map. In a second phase, the dense forest cover of the 1980s and 2000s were obtained by processing of Landsat TM and ETM+ satellite images. First the geometric correction of the satellite images was performed. Then, series of supervised classifications based on the maximum likelihood method were done to generate maps of land cover, with overall accuracies of 90%. From these land cover maps, the class of dense forests was extracted and converted into a map layer in vector format. By crossing dense forests covers of the 1980s and 2000 with those of the 1960s, the specific characterizations of those forests were derived (Figure 1, 2, 3). The results show a dense humid forest cover of about 8.4 million ha in 1960, with the presence of large blocks. The 1980s and 2000s have dense forest cover of 2.6 million ha and 1.35 million ha, respectively (Tables 1, 2, 3). These latter periods are characterized by high loss and fragmentation of rainforests in Côte d'Ivoire. Thus, since its independence, the country has lost more than 80% of its forest cover. The results of this study show that clearing associated with industrial agriculture mainly cocoa, coffee and rubber farming as well as demographic pressure and abusive exploitation of valuable wood species for export are the main causes of deforestation in Cote d'Ivoire. This study advocates the restoration of forests through the implementation of an awareness policy and reforestation one hand, and an efficient monitoring and protection of national protected areas and parks.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-3332-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7729337","Tropical forest;multitemporal monitoring;image classification;three;four;five","Satellites;Remote sensing;Monitoring;Sea measurements;Earth;Loss measurement;Africa","geophysical image processing;maximum likelihood estimation;photogrammetry;vegetation mapping","AD 1960 to 2000;forest cover multitemporal monitoring;Cote Divoire;deforestation phenomenon;colonial period;spatial dense rainforests evolution;temporal dense rainforests evolution;remote sensing data;aerial photograph;low spatial resolution;NOAA;AVHRR;forest cover area estimate;multitemporal data;vegetation map digitization;Landsat TM satellite image;Landsat ETM+ satellite image;maximum likelihood method;land cover map layer;vector format;rainforest fragmentation;cocoa farming;coffee farming;rubber farming;demographic pressure;wood species;reforestation;awareness policy;national protected area;national protected park","","1","","11","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This motivates us to look deeper into the supervised DL methods and investigate how they can be adopted intelligently for CD by minimizing the requirement of labeled training data. Towards this, in this work we show that geographically diverse training dataset can yield significant improvement over less diverse training datasets of the same size.

They are generally stated as an energy minimization problem where specific penalty terms are applied to each component of the sought decomposition.

The present algorithms for paddy rice recognition are mainly based on the unique physical features of paddy rice and the vegetation indices, which are sensitive to dynamics of the canopy and surface water content. In this study, the rice growth calendar data and the cropping pattern (e.g., single rice or double rice) information were used to improve present phenology-based rice recognition approach by determining the potential temporal window of flooding and transplanting periods over a year.

Obtaining multi-temporal data via satellite images in different spatial domains with various scales is one of the key developments of monitoring spatial variability of soil salinity. In addition, geo-statistical methods have the capability of producing prediction surfaces from limited sample data. This study aims to map spatial distribution of soil salinity in the selected pilot area which is located in the western part of Urmia Lake Basin, Iran, by applying geo-statistical methods. A kriging based map and three different co-kriging based maps were produced using electrical conductivity (EC) measurements as primary variable and three different soil salinity index values as secondary variable. Three soil salinity indices were created by using Sentinel-2A image that were acquired in the same date of field measurements to generate 3 various soil salinity prediction maps. Salinity maps obtained from geo-statistical methods were compared and validated to understand the performance of these approaches for soil salinity prediction. The results of this study demonstrated that co-kriging can provide promising estimation of spatial variability of soil salinity especially when there is relevant and abundant set of secondary data derived from satellite images.","","978-1-7281-2116-1","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820609","Soil Salinity;Co-kriging;Remote Sensing;Salinity Indices;Sentinel 2-A;Urmia Lake Basin","Salinity (geophysical);Soil;Lakes;Indexes;Monitoring;Graphical models;Distribution functions","electrical conductivity;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;hydrological techniques;lakes;remote sensing;salinity (geophysical);soil;statistical analysis","geo-statistical methods;soil sustainability;geo-statistical approaches;economic prediction;different spatial domains;spatial variability;map spatial distribution;different co-kriging based maps;primary variable soil salinity index values;three different soil salinity index values;soil salinity indices;soil salinity prediction;salinity maps;current 2.0 A","","","","25","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, in the most of cases users do not take into account any estimation of index uncertainty. This information can be useful and desirable especially in multi-temporal analysis to define index sensitivity with the aim of identifying significant differences between pixels of the same scene or of the same pixel in time. The goal of this work is to investigate potential uncertainty affecting spectral indices, with particular focus on NDVI (Normalized Vegetation Index). An “open” (entirely controllable) self-developed radiative transfer model is considered for this study. Uncertainty concerning factors involved in the model was considered to estimate its effects on NDVI final accuracy. For this task the statistical model of the variance propagation law was adopted. Two Landsat 8 OLI images acquired over a sample study area sited in Piemonte (NW Italy) were used to compute NDVI images at two different dates, estimate its uncertainty and investigate the way this information can be exploited during a change detection analysis.","2153-7003","978-1-4799-7929-5","10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7325842","Landsat 8 OLI;NDVI accuracy;change detection;Variance Propagation Law","Uncertainty;Remote sensing;Vegetation mapping;Reflectivity;Indexes;Satellites;Earth","geophysical image processing;radiative transfer;statistical analysis;vegetation;vegetation mapping","remote sensing applications;vegetation monitoring;spectral indices;index uncertainty;multitemporal analysis;index sensitivity;Normalized Vegetation Index;open self-developed radiative transfer model;statistical model;variance propagation law;Landsat 8 OLI images;Piemonte;NW Italy;NDVI images;change detection analysis;NDVI uncertainty mapping;NDVI uncertainty estimation;operational approach","","1","","10","IEEE","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The recent research works dominated by hyperspectral binary change detection, however, cannot provide fine change classes information. And most methods incorporating spectral unmixing for hyperspectral multiclass change detection (HMCD), yet suffer from the neglection of temporal correlation and error accumulation. In this study, we proposed an unsupervised Binary Change Guided hyperspectral multiclass change detection Network (BCG-Net) for HMCD, which aims at boosting the multiclass change detection result and unmixing result with the mature binary change detection approaches. In BCG-Net, a novel partial-siamese united-unmixing module is designed for multi-temporal spectral unmixing, and a groundbreaking temporal correlation constraint directed by the pseudo-labels of binary change detection result is developed to guide the unmixing process from the perspective of change detection, encouraging the abundance of the unchanged pixels more coherent and that of the changed pixels more accurate. Moreover, an innovative binary change detection rule is put forward to deal with the problem that traditional rule is susceptible to numerical values. The iterative optimization of the spectral unmixing process and the change detection process is proposed to eliminate the accumulated errors and bias from unmixing result to change detection result. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed BCG-Net could achieve comparative or even outstanding performance of multiclass change detection among the state-of-the-art approaches and gain better spectral unmixing results at the same time.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2022.3233187","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3903302); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:T2122014,61971317); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2020CFB594); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10011164","Hyperspectral multiclass change detection;multi-temporal unmixing;temporal correlation constraint;unsupervised learning;deep neural network","Correlation;Hyperspectral imaging;Feature extraction;Optimization;Neural networks;Multitasking;Iterative methods","geophysical image processing;image classification;iterative methods;remote sensing;signal classification","BCG-Net;binary change detection result;change detection process;changed pixels;error accumulation;fine change classes information;gain better spectral unmixing results;hyperspectral binary change detection;hyperspectral image;innovative binary change detection rule;mature binary change detection approaches;methods incorporating spectral unmixing;multiclass change detection result;multitemporal spectral unmixing;novel partial-siamese united-unmixing module;spectral unmixing process;temporal correlation;tremendous spectral information;unmixing result;unsupervised Binary Change Guided hyperspectral multiclass change detection","","","","62","IEEE","6 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Located in the northern part of Shandong Province and in proximity to the Yellow River Delta, Dongying City is one of areas most prone to the migratory locust plague in East of China. Traditional methods on monitoring and preventing outbreaks of locust are mainly based on field activities. It costs a lot of labors and time actually. Therefore, to generate data that would guide policies aimed at timely prevention and control of such a plague efficiently, we have monitored locust habitat distribution in this area using multi-temporal Landsat OLI images acquired from February to October in 2015. There are six Landsat OLI images were used all. A decision tree classification approach was employed to discriminate locust habitat from the surrounding land-cover based on the seasonal variation of different land-cover types. There are two commonly used spectral vegetation indices in decision tree classification algorithms for this study including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI). Based on the production rules from the decision tree algorithms, seven land-cover categories were identified in this study as follows: locust habitat, dry land, water, paddy rice, urban, forest, and others. The classification results were evaluated by 327 random verification points from yield investigated (forest and locust habitat) and Google Earth images (dry land, water, paddy rice, urban, and others) respectively. According to the classification mapping result, approximately 8.5% of the total area was extracted as “oriental migratory locust habitat”. Also, locust habitat mainly distributed in Hekou district and Kenli district near the Yellow river especially. The accuracy assessment of the resultant classification map indicated an overall accuracy of 87.16% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.849 from the error matrix, which is typically higher than traditional supervised classification methods such as maximum likelihood. Also, water produced the highest accuracy as expected. For locust habitat land-cover types, the classification result produced the producer accuracy and the user accuracy with 81.255 and 92.86% respectively. These results have demonstrated that multi-temporal-data-based decision tree mapping methods can well exploit the tremendous potential of different vegetation phenological characteristics for extracting oriental migratory locust habitat and improving overall land-cover classification accuracy to some degree. In general, the classification result from decision tree method can be used for early locust damage prevention and produce a scientific guidance in Dongying city further.","","978-1-5386-5038-7","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2018.8476141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8476141","Mapping;Dongying City;Landsat OLI;Oriental migratory locust;Locust habitat","Remote sensing;Earth;Artificial satellites;Decision trees;Vegetation mapping;Urban areas;Rivers","decision trees;geophysical image processing;image classification;terrain mapping;vegetation;vegetation mapping","land-cover types;land-cover categories;locust habitat land-cover types;traditional supervised classification methods;classification mapping result;forest;dry land;decision tree algorithms;Land Surface Water Index;decision tree classification algorithms;decision tree classification approach;multitemporal Landsat OLI images;locust habitat distribution;migratory locust plague;Dongying City;early locust damage prevention;decision tree method;land-cover classification accuracy;oriental migratory locust habitat;multitemporal-data-based decision tree mapping methods","","1","","17","IEEE","30 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The high flows that rivers have are caused by changes in flood bed or low canal flow, also it changes river channel morphology. Floods that occur during the spring months cause significant geomorphological changes. In addition to this, low flows during the summer also trigger erosion and superficial accumulation in the ongoing process. Using an accurate, high-resolution, seamless surface models of the river channel and floodplain allows to detect morphological changes of the whole river channel more accurately than using traditional methods. This enables a more comprehensive view of the riverbed evolution. Therefore, high-quality topographical data at different scales are required to study fluvial processes and river dynamics. Nowadays, a combination of photogrammetry and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems is widely used for various applications, especially for 3D surface modelling and large scale mapping. UAV systems offer many advantages in terms of cost and image resolution when compared to terrestrial photogrammetry and satellite remote sensing systems.

Many of them exploit the DL models (e.g., Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE)) as a feature extractor and use the retrieved features to detect the changes. However, these features do not efficiently preserve the geometrical details, and they do not optimize the selection of informative features for change detection. We propose an unsupervised DL CD method that exploits the features extracted by a CAE trained with a super-resolution based loss function. The loss function allows the CAE to be trained to reconstruct the spatial information thus generating features preserving the geometrical details. The proposed method exploits a feature selection based on the Structured Similarity Index (SSIM) to perform a texture analysis and chooses couples of bi-temporal features providing relevant information about changes.

This paper proposes a manifold-based approach for binary change detection in multitemporal hyperspectral images using Laplacian Eigenmaps. The multitemporal difference is represented in the eigenspace of the Laplacian matrix, and the resulting latent vectors are utilized to cluster the changed vs. unchanged regions using k-means clustering. The clusters obtained from the first two latent vectors are combined to obtain the binary change detection map. The proposed method is fully supervised and no thresholding is required.

However, considering the long revisit time of most optical and radar sensors orbiting the Earth, multi-temporal disasters monitoring remains a very challenging task. In this paper, a multimodal, multitemporal approach for fusing optical and radar images in the context of flooded areas extraction is introduced. First, potential flooded pixels contained in pre-and post-disaster images are extracted based on the Structural Feature Set (SFS) texture measurement and a modified water index. Then, Attribute Filters (AF) are applied to the resulting images in order to filter out small-sized objects and retain high probability flooded areas. Finally, homogeneous regions resulting from the previous step are used to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier used later to classify optical or radar images of the event into flooded and unflooded areas. In order to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, our methodology was applied to time-series optical and radar images acquired before and during three different flooding events: 1) Rockhampton, Australia in 2017; 2) Texas, USA in 2017; and 3) Kerala, India in 2018. Experiments show that our approach gives very promising results and demonstrate the potential of fusing multimodal and multitemporal images.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8899289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8899289","Multimodal images;texture analysis;flood monitoring;attribute filters","Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Indexes;Radar polarimetry;Optical filters;Laser radar;Optical variables measurement","disasters;feature extraction;floods;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;geophysics computing;hydrological techniques;image classification;neural nets;radar imaging;remote sensing;self-organising feature maps;terrain mapping;time series","multimodal approach;flood monitoring;time-series satellite images combining Attribute Filters;kohonen map;remote sensing data;affected area;night imaging capability;long revisit time;optical radar sensors;multitemporal approach;fusing optical;radar images;flooded areas extraction;post-disaster;Structural Feature Set texture measurement;Artificial Neural Network classifier;unflooded areas;time-series optical;different flooding events;multimodal images;multitemporal images","","","","7","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Sundarbans is called the shelter of Bangladesh as it protects southern coastal regions from natural disasters such as Cyclones, and typhoons. However, the mighty Sundarbans are dying because of climate changes, excessive human activities and the overwhelming consumption of natural forest resources. The primary objective of this study is to classify and detect deforested areas due to natural and anthropogenic causes. This study used Sentinel 2A Imageries of year 2016 & 2022 to detect forest cover changes in between the time period. In this study, the transfer learning method was applied to classify deforested areas. The transfer learning method uses the knowledge of a pre-trained model to build the new model. The UNet was the base model where weight from the pre-trained ResNet34 model trained on the ImageNet dataset (https://www.image-net.org/) was used as the backend. The dataset was divided into two sets where 80% of data was used in training and 20% was used for model validation. Average training and validation accuracy for both 2016 and 2022 data were close to 98%. The predicted images and ground truth data were similar and the model captured rivers, deforested areas, and vegetation approximately. We found that there were 1426.71 sq. mi of forest covers in the year-2016 which reduced to 1394.26 sq. mi in 2022 (3.5% of total area). This study also found interesting information about natural reforestation. We found that between 2016–2022, 56.89 sq. mi of forest cover was deforested whereas 24.44 sq. mi of deforested land cover was converted back into forest cover.

Henan province, which is the largest region of winter wheat cultivation in China, late spring frost damage has been one of the major meteorological catastrophes. For systematical and accurate monitoring and estimation of single-event frost damage of winter wheat, serial GF-1 remotely sensed imageries were collected during the winter wheat growth with field investigations and yield measurements in Yanjin county, Henan. Field investigation across Yanjin county based on five grades (normal growth, frost damage grade I to frost damage grade IV) defined by the agricultural indicators was conducted on 15 April and in which 133 ground samples were collected. Based on the investigation, the remotely sensed monitoring and estimation indicated that frost-affected areas accounted for 87.71% of the winter wheat planting area in the whole county. From frost damage I to frost damage IV, the frost-affected areas accounted for 55.52%, 15.79%, 2.90% and 16.32%, respectively. The frost-affected regions were distributed from northeast to southwest of the county, showing zonal distribution; and the severe frost damage regions showed scattered and irregular distribution. Based on the agronomic freezing indicators, it can be concluded that the frost damage III and frost damage IV would cause yield loss of the winter wheat. In an average year, the yield of winter wheat in Yanjin county was about 6750-9000 kg/ha. In 2018, the yield of winter wheat for normal growth and mild frost damage (grade I) was about 6750 kg/ha according to the field investigation; whereas, the yield of winter wheat was 3000-4500 kg/ha for slight frost damage (grade II) which did not form a disaster; and the yield of winter wheat was 600-2250 kg/ha for the severe frost damage (grade III and IV). According to the proportions of areas affected by the frost damage and the yield for different grades, the yield reduction of winter wheat caused by this late spring frost was about 24%-33% in 2018. Our findings reveal region-specific changes in the spring-frost risk that can inform decision-making in land management, forestry, agriculture, and insurance policy.","","978-1-7281-6561-5","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics50104.2021.9530308","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530308","late spring frost;GF-1 remotely sensed imagery;support vector machine (SVM);winter wheat;frost damage;yield loss","Support vector machines;Decision making;Estimation;Insurance;Forestry;Global warming;Agriculture","agriculture;crops;disasters;forestry;freezing;geophysical image processing;global warming;ice;remote sensing","winter wheat cultivation;late spring frost damage;single-event frost damage;winter wheat growth;field investigation;Yanjin county;frost damage grade;frost-affected areas;winter wheat planting area;frost-affected regions;severe frost damage regions;mild frost damage;slight frost damage;spring-frost risk;multitemporal GF-1 remotely sensed imagery;Henan province;China;meteorological catastrophes;agronomic freezing indicators;region-specific changes;mass 9000.0 kg;mass 6750.0 kg;mass 4500.0 kg;mass 2250.0 kg","","","","15","IEEE","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study used multi - temporal Landsat satellite images to assess changes in forests and other LULC along the Indus River’s Bindi Dheraja Sukkar in southern Pakistan. Forest and other LULC were classified using multitemporal Landsat data obtained during the years 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2017. In addition, from the classed maps of 2008 and 2017, forest cover and other LULC change detection maps were created. Ground sample locations and high-resolution Google Earth images were used to verify the final maps. According to the findings, forest area reduced by 17.18 percent with a yearly decline rate of 1.72 percent from 2008 to 2017, whereas agriculture land rose by 26.4 percent with a yearly growth rate of 2.6 percent. With a yearly drop rate of 0.48 percent, the area of water bodies and barren land declined by 4.85 percent and 4.81 percent, respectively.

The inpainting methods fill the areas via image patches from the image itself. Lacking prior information of the cloudy areas, these methods are limited in reconstructing accuracy, especially when clouds lie on the boundaries of two types of landscapes. We propose a new method based on the inpanting method which take the SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images as a prior structure information of contaminated.

A novel method of cloud and cloud shadow removal called Multitemporal Cloud Removal (MCR) is proposed in this paper. The method has main steps: (1) radiometric correction, (2) cloud and cloud shadow detection, and (3) image reconstruction. Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiometric correction converts digital number values to TOA reflectance for Landsat 8 OLI was first completed. In the second step, Multi-temporal Cloud Masking (MCM) was used to detect cloud and cloud shadow. This method uses a target image which has cloud and cloud shadow contaminated pixels and a reference image which is clear. The aim is to obtain the difference in reflectance values in visible, near-infrared and short wave infrared bands between target and reference images. These values can be used to detect cloud and cloud shadow in Landsat 8 images. The Landsat 8 cirrus band is used to detect thin cirrus cloud in this method. We use target image and reference image from a sequence acquisition dates of Landsat 8 images to avoid the significant land cover change. In the last step, we use multitemporal images to reconstruct pixels which are contaminated by cloud and cloud shadow. Cloud and cloud shadow contaminated pixels on the target image are replaced by pixels from the reference image. Landsat 8 images which have heterogeneous land cover and variety of cloud types are chosen in the experiments to prove that MCR is robust method for removing cloud and cloud shadow and can be used for image that has heterogeneous land cover and variety of cloud types. We use visual and statistical assessments to evaluate the results. As results show, cloud and cloud shadow can be removed by MCR. In visual evaluation, the corrected images are similar to the reference image. In statistical assessments between corrected and references images, the correlation coefficient for each band is quite high (>0.9) for the thick cloud case and equal to 1 for thin cloud case. Within band tandard deviations in the reference image and the corrected image were higher in the corrected image compared to the the reference image and original image. Although not comprehensive, the visual and statistical assessments, provide some indication that th MCR method was robust method for removing cloud and cloud shadow in Landsat 8 images examined in this work. The advantage of this appoach is that original reflectance values can be retained as long as they are not contaminated by cloud and cloud shadow. In addition, as we use a sequence acquisition date of Landsat 8 images, we can produce free cloud and cloud shadow images.","","978-1-5386-3884-2","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2017.8047007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8047007","cloud;cloud shadow;multitemporal cloud removal;multitemporal images;Landsat 8","Clouds;Earth;Satellites;Remote sensing;Reflectivity;Standards;Time series analysis","clouds;geographic information systems;geophysical image processing;image reconstruction;land cover;remote sensing;terrain mapping","reference image;landsat 8 images;free cloud;cloud shadow images;cloud shadow cover;cloud shadow detection;multitemporal cloud removal method;satellite images;remote sensing;geoinformation systems;time series analysis;radiometric correction;image reconstruction;top-of-atmosphere;digital number values;TOA reflectance;Landsat 8 OLI;multitemporal cloud masking;target image;visible wave infrared bands;near-infrared bands;short wave infrared bands;heterogeneous land cover","","5","1","14","IEEE","21 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By exploring the relationship between imaging environment and the object spectra, the spectral transformation is used to suppress the phenomenon of “same object with different spectra”. Besides, a detection network with joint spectral-spatial feature learning is designed to extract the spectral-spatial features simultaneously to make the CD algorithm more robust.

Quick response to a large-scale natural disaster such as earthquake and tsunami is vital to mitigate the further loss. Remote sensing especially the spaceborne sensors provide the solution to monitor a huge area in a short time and with regular revisit circle. Damage ranges and damage levels of the destructed urban areas are extremely important information for rescue planning after an event. Rapid mapping of the urban damage levels with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is still challenging. Compared with single-polarization SAR, fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) has the better potential to understand the urban damage from the viewpoint of scattering mechanism investigation. In radar polarimetry, dominant double-bounce scattering mechanism in urban area is primarily induced by the ground-wall structures and can reflect the changes of these structures. In this sense, urban damage level in terms of destroyed ground-wall structures can be indicated by the reduction of the dominant double-bounce scattering mechanism, which is the basis of this study. This work first establishes and validates the linear relationship between the urban damage level and the established polarimetric damage index using polarimetric model-based decomposition. Then, efforts are focused on the development of a rapid urban damage level mapping technique which mainly includes two steps of urban area extraction and polarimetric damage level estimation. The 3.11 East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami inducing great-scale destructions selected for study using multi-temporal spaceborne PolSAR data. Experimental studies demonstrate that the estimated damage levels are closely consistent to the ground-truth. The final urban damage level map for the full scene is generated thereafter. Results achieved in this study further validate the necessity of exploring fully polarimetric technique for damage investigation.","","978-1-5090-6093-1","10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7735038","","Synthetic aperture radar;Earthquakes;Tsunami;Electromagnetics;Electromagnetic scattering;Remote sensing","disasters;earthquakes;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar;tsunami","urban damage mapping;fully polarimetric SAR data;synthetic aperture radar;interpretation technique;large-scale natural disaster;remote sensing;spaceborne sensors;destructed urban areas;rescue planning;rapid mapping;urban damage levels;radar polarimetry;ground-wall structures;dominant double-bounce scattering mechanism;polarimetric damage index;polarimetric model-based decomposition;rapid urban damage level mapping;urban area extraction;polarimetric damage level estimation;east Japan earthquake;tsunami;temporal spaceborne PolSAR data","","","","","IEEE","10 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By analyzing the difference information of multi-temporal images, the labels of unchanged region can be transferred form source domain to the target domain. In order to further utilize the difference information and learn a robust classifier, we propose an iterative difference learning network (IDLnet) to update land-cover maps in this paper. The proposed method aims at optimizing the process of label transfer by analyzing results of classifier and to fine-tuning it with a series of dynamic training sets. In proposed method, we first utilize the source domain data to initialize a training set and train a classifier to classify both the source and target domains. The change detection (CD) is applied on the ground image datasets and the classification result. Then the transfer learning (TL) is employed to transfer the unchanged information to fine-tuning network. We detect changes of the classification result images again and fuse the previous CD results.

In this method, a large number of SAR images are observed to analyze the probable positions of the targets. In the test images, we only need to detect targets and detect the change of targets in prior positions.

Due to that crop acreage information is the important basis for making national food policy and economy plan, therefore, it is very important that conduct the study on crop identification. In view of the advantages of high temporal resolution, wide coverage and low cost, remote sensing has been used in a wide arrange of earth observation activities and thus provides a useful tool for crop recognition and planting acreage monitoring at a large scale. Since the 1980's, optical remote sensing has been widely used to identify various crops, however, optical images are not often available in the key growth period of crops, owing to the cloudy and rainy weather. Thus, it has a negative effect on the accuracy and timeliness of crop area monitoring. As a new high-technology with an advantage of all-weather, all-time, high resolution and wide coverage, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely applied in agricultural condition monitoring field and thus provides a strong complement and support for crop identification in data and technology aspect. As the updating and improvement of function parameters and performance index of radar sensors, it has been an important field of agriculture remote sensing that getting the information of crop sown acreage, growing condition and yield by SAR. In this paper, according to a mainline that the development progress of radar technology in the recent twenty years, the progress of studies and applications on crop discrimination by SAR is systematically summarized, and the conclusion includes 4 aspects: the first is early studies (from the late 1980's to 2002), are characterized by using single band, single polarization and multi-temporal SAR data for crop identification; The second is crop acreage monitoring based on multi-polarization, multiband SAR data, furthermore, the section can be divided into 2 subsections: one is crop recognition by multi-polarization SAR, the other is using multiple SAR sensors to crop classification; The third is studies on improving the accuracy and efficiency of crop identification by combining SAR with optical remote sensing; The last is the studies on crop classification algorithm using SAR data. According to the summary of previous studies, the problems existing in the crop identification by SAR can be analyzed as follows: the first is that crop type identified by SAR are still single; the second is that the accuracies of crop identification are not high yet; the last is that mechanism studies on classification algorithm are lack. Furthermore, the development trends are presented in this study. Dry-land crop discrimination using SAR images under a complex crop planting structure, improving the accuracy and timeliness of crop identification by optimizing the operational parameters (e.g. polarization, frequency and incidence angle) of SAR system and combining with optical remote sensing, developing the mechanism-based algorithm of crop classification will be 3 contents urgently need to be studied in the future.","","978-1-4673-8087-4","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2015.7248111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7248111","synthetic aperture radar (SAR);crop identification;multi-polarization;multiband;classification algorithm","Agriculture;Synthetic aperture radar;Remote sensing;Classification algorithms;Monitoring;Accuracy","agriculture;condition monitoring;crops;image classification;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","crop identification;synthetic aperture radar;SAR;crop yield estimation model;crop acreage information;crop recognition;optical remote sensing;agricultural condition monitoring;classification algorithm","","2","","76","IEEE","10 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To efficiently obtain optimal multitemporal LULC classification maps, the hybrid framework utilizes a spatial-temporal semantic segmentation model to harness temporal dependency for extracting high-level spatial-temporal features. In addition, the principle of postclassification relearning is adopted to efficiently optimize model output. Thereby, the initial outcome of a semantic segmentation model is provided to a subsequent model via an extended input space to guide the learning of discriminative feature representations in an end-to-end fashion. Last, object-based voting is coupled with postclassification relearning for coping with the high intraclass and low interclass variances. The framework was tested with two different postclassification relearning strategies (i.e., pixel-based relearning and object-based relearning) and three convolutional neural network models, i.e., UNet, a simple Convolutional LSTM, and a UNet Convolutional-LSTM. The experiments were conducted on two datasets with LULC labels that contain rich semantic information and variant building morphologic features (e.g., informal settlements).

However, precise measurements, such as from airborne or spaceborne 3D laser scanning (LiDAR), are expensive and usually cover only small areas. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning model that can generate detailed maps of tree canopy heights. In contrast to previous approaches that use a single image as input, we process multi-temporal data via a an adaptation of the popular U-Net architecture that is based on the EfficientNet and 3D convolution operators. To that end, our model receives multi-spectral Landsat satellite imagery as input and can predict continuous height maps. As labeled data, we resort to spatially sparse LiDAR data from ICESat-2. Thus, with such a model, one can produce dense canopy height maps given only multi-spectral Landsat data. Our experimental evaluation shows that our our model outperforms existing and improved single-temporal models. To test generalizability, we created a non-overlapping dataset to evaluate our approach and further tested the model performance on out-of-distribution data. The results show that our model can successfully learn drastic changes in distribution.","","978-1-6654-3902-2","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9672018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9672018","Neural Networks;Spatio-Temporal Data;Canopy Height Prediction;Landsat;ICESat-2","Earth;Deep learning;Adaptation models;Artificial satellites;Satellites;Atmospheric modeling;Forestry","deep learning (artificial intelligence);geophysical image processing;image classification;optical radar;remote sensing by laser beam;remote sensing by radar;vegetation;vegetation mapping","dense canopy height maps;multispectral Landsat data;single-temporal models;out-of-distribution data;forest canopy height;multitemporal imagery;carbon uptake;airborne D laser scanning;spaceborne 3D laser scanning;deep learning model;detailed maps;tree canopy heights;single image;process multitemporal data;U-Net architecture;3D convolution operators;multispectral Landsat satellite imagery;continuous height maps;spatially sparse LiDAR data","","","","32","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Changes in vegetation happen due to reasons ranging from climate change and damages to new government policies and regulations. Remote sensing imagery (multi-spectral and multi-temporal) is widely used in change pattern mapping studies. Existing bi-temporal change detection techniques are better suited for multi-spectral images and time series based techniques are more suited for analyzing multi-temporal images. A key contribution of this work is to define change as hierarchical rather than boolean. Based on this definition of change pattern, we developed a novel time series similarity based change detection framework for identifying inter-annual changes by exploiting phenological properties of growing crops from satellite time series imagery. The proposed framework consists of three components: hierarchical clustering tree construction, nearest neighbor based classification, and change detection using similarity hierarchy. Though the proposed approach is unsupervised, we present evaluation using manually induced change regions embedded in the real dataset. We compare our method with the widely used K-Means clustering and evaluation shows that K-Means over-detects changes in comparison to our proposed method.","","978-1-4673-9005-7","10.1109/BigData.2016.7840735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7840735","Hierarchical Clustering;k-Nearest Neighbors;Change Detection;Remote Sensing;MODIS;NDVI","Time series analysis;Agriculture;Vegetation mapping;Clustering algorithms;Remote sensing;Indexes;MODIS;Climate change","crops;geographic information systems;image processing;monitoring;pattern classification;pattern clustering;remote sensing;time series;trees (mathematics)","scalable nearest neighbor;hierarchical change detection framework;crop monitoring;biomass monitoring;geographic regions;vegetation;remote sensing imagery;change pattern mapping;bitemporal change detection;multispectral images;time series;hierarchical clustering tree construction;nearest neighbor based classification;K-means clustering","","3","","9","IEEE","6 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the impact of climate changes and human activities, the distribution of locust habitat (locust habitat is the environment in which locusts live and survive) in China is constantly changing. Monitoring and extracting locust habitat are of great significance for guiding large-scale agricultural production. The occurrence of the locust is closely related to their habitat. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of habitat factors that affect locust survival is carried out to monitor locust habitat distribution. Besides, the landscape structure also affects distribution. This study explored a model for analyzing multi-temporal Landsat and MODIS images, which combined multiple habitat factors and landscape structure to analyze locust habitat. The locust habitat near North Dagang Reservoir in Tianjin is the research object. First, the habitat factors that affect locust oviposition and growth were analyzed, and vegetation coverage, land cover class, soil moisture, soil salinity, and land surface temperature were selected as five habitat factors. The weights of five habitat factors were evaluated according to the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model. Then, considering the impact of landscape structure on locust habitat, a moving-window was used to correlate locust habitat factors at pixel scale with locust habitat at patch scale. Finally, the distribution map of the locust habitat at patch scale was generated. The Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP) was used to compare and test the results. Our research shows that the Patch based - Analytic Hierarchy Process (PB-AHP) can monitor locust habitat. The overall accuracy reached 88%, which is 10% higher than the result based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP).

In this article, we develop a novel crop classification method based on spatiotemporal deep-learning fusion technology. However, for crop mapping, the selection and labeling of training samples is expensive and time consuming. Therefore, we propose a fully automated training-sample-selection method. First, we design the method according to image processing algorithms and the concept of a sliding window. Second, we develop the Geo-3D convolutional neural network (CNN) and Geo-Conv1D for crop classification using time-series Sentinel-2 imagery. Specifically, we integrate geographic information of crops into the structure of deep-learning networks. Finally, we apply an active learning strategy to integrate the classification advantages of Geo-3D CNN and Geo-Conv1D. Experiments conducted in Northeast China show that the proposed sampling method can reliably provide and label a large number of samples and achieve satisfactory results for different deep-learning networks. Based on the automatic selection and labeling of training samples, the crop classification method based on spatiotemporal deep-learning fusion technology can achieve the highest overall accuracy (OA) with approximately 92.50% as compared with Geo-Conv1D (91.89%) and Geo-3D CNN (91.27%) in the three study areas, indicating that the proposed method is effective and efficient in multi-temporal crop classification.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3113014","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41871225,41871248,41771400); Project of Jilin Province Development and Reform Commission(grant numbers:2021C044-7); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9563080","Active learning;Crops;Classification algorithms;Data fusion;Deep learning;Training samples","Crops;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Training;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution","agriculture;crops;geographic information systems;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;remote sensing;sampling methods","Geo-3D convolutional neural network;Geo-Conv1D;time-series Sentinel-2 imagery;deep-learning networks;active learning strategy;classification advantages;Geo-3D CNN;sampling method;automatic selection;fusion technology;multitemporal crop classification;timely crop mapping;deep-learning methods;remotely sensed data sources;novel crop classification method;fully automated training-sample-selection method;image processing algorithms","","1","","54","IEEE","7 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, an unsupervised SAR image change detection fusion framework based on shearlet transform is proposed. In the proposed method, The Gauss filtering is combined with log-ratio to impair speckle. Then the difference map (DM) of Gauss-log ratio and the difference map of ratio based on Gabor feature are fused with shearlet transform. Meanwhile, DM is decomposed to low frequency image and four high frequency images, different fusion rules are used in multi-scales images respectively, the work of noise reduction is operated with mean filtering. After an inverse shearlet transformation, the final change map can be obtained via a simple OSTU segmentation. The real SAR image pairs in Bern area are used to verify proposed change detection method.

A longer moving window length (number of overpasses with ω constant) is recommended to ensure adequate degrees of information for retrieval and to prevent spurious, rapid changes in ω.

Therefore, it is of significance to accurately and timely obtain the LULC maps on the earth’s surface, in particular for those regions where dramatic LULC changes are undergoing. Since 2017 April, a new state-level new area, Xiong’an New Area, was established in China, which would inevitably lead to some LULC changes in this region. In order to better understand what kinds of LULC change in this region with more details and further evaluate the potential impacts that the LULC changes will bring, this study makes full use of the 10-m multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images on the cloud-computing Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the powerful classification capability of Random Forest (RF) models, to generate the continuous LULC maps in Xiong’an New Area from 2017 to 2020. The derived LULC map for each year in Xiong’an New Area achieves high accuracy, with OA and Kappa values less than 0.9. Based on the obtained LULC maps, this study analyzed the spatial and temporal changes of LULC types in the last four years. It revealed that the estimated dry farmland has decreased from 2017 to 2018 and then kept almost stable, and the majority of it has converted to non-cropland, especially to the tree seedlings and landscape dual-use regions. The estimated impervious areas that were mainly composed of buildings and transport infrastructures first increased due to the newly constructed Xiong’an Station with some high-speed roads and then decreased from 2019 to 2020, mainly due to the relocation of some small villages. Accordingly, some building groups and aggregations were going to show in this region, and are expected to further developed in the future. Other LULC types such as lakes and forests have not changed dramatically, indicating that the environmental protection in Xiong’an New Area was, to date, satisfactory. The obtained 10-m and 4-year LULC maps in this study can provide some valuable information on the monitoring and understanding of what kinds of changes were and will be undergoing in Xiong’an New Area, and can also be used for evaluating the potential impacts and challenges such as environmental protection. Additionally, the utilization of GEE and the multi-temporal 10-m Sentinel-2 images can help to achieve LULC mapping in this region in an accurate and timely manner, which can be used in future studies.","","978-1-7281-6561-5","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics50104.2021.9530306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530306","Land Use and Land Cover Change;Xiong’an New District;Google Earth Engine;Multi-temporal classification","Earth;Roads;Climate change;Vegetation mapping;Land surface;Radiometry;Internet","cloud computing;geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;land use;remote sensing;terrain mapping","Xiongan New Area;LULC mapping;state-level new area;Sentinel-2 images;cloud computing;Google Earth Engine;Land Use and Land Cover change analysis;AD 2017 to 2020;China;GEE;random forest;tree seedlings;lakes;forests","","","","26","IEEE","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Secondly, a binary change mask is extracted from the spectrum correction image by using Otsu. Then multiply it with the overlaying multi-temporal image to extract reliable change region. Finally, the transference process is realized by using an improved Fuzzy C-Means algorithm. Additionally, considering that Fuzzy C-Means cannot determine the cluster center and cluster number automatically, and also be sensitive to the noise, the article utilizes membership entropy to determine the optimal cluster number, and adopts the max-minimum distance to initialize the cluster center, which can avoid trapping in local optimum caused by selecting cluster center randomly, and also introduces the similarity-weight of the neighbor pixels to correct the membership function. Experiments show that the combination of pre-classification with post-classification comparison can realize the whole change process and also alleviate error propagation effects of multi-classification, which makes the change detection results closer to the real situation.

However, for the dataset with more than three bands, the fusion process is complicated. Because only every three bands are fused repeatedly for multiple times until all bands are fused. The hyperspherical color sharpening (HCS) fusion method can fuse the dataset with more than three bands. The HCS approach uses a transform between n-dimensional Cartesian space and n-dimensional hyperspherical space. Moreover, from a structural point of view, the hyperspherical color space is very similar to the IHS color space. Although the existing principal component analysis (PCA) and Gram Schmidt (GS) methods are also able to integrate the dataset with more than three bands, but they, especially the PCA, usually lead to the spectral distortion. Hence, we propose the Ehlers-HCS fusion method to fuse n band datasets, even to hyperspectral images. The original Ehlers fusion renamed as Ehlers-IHS fusion for easy distinction. The WorldView-2 dataset including a panchromatic and eight multispectral bands are used as the input experimental real data.

Besides, Spectral indices were utilized to define the ground truth. Thus, the study area was divided into four main land use/cover classes, and hence five satellite images for the years; 1997, 2007, 2014, 2017, and 2019 with low cloud cover were identified. According to the study, urban development resulted in a significant conversion of vegetation cover to the urban development of around 36 km2 during the past 22 years. The generated map showed that between 1997 and 2019, the built-up area increased by 43.62 percent whereas vegetation cover decreased by 41.72 percent. The overall precision of the data produced ranged from 72 to 81 percent. The dramatic growth of the urban population will boost the risk of natural environmental diminishing.

Extreme gradient boosting is the regularized extension of traditional boosting techniques and could overcome the overfitting constrain of gradient boosting (a.k.a gradient boosting machine). Three types of booster which are linear booster, tree booster and DART (Dropouts meet Multiple Additive Regression Trees) booster were tested on XGBoost for crop classification.

This requires that disdrometers with spatial variability should be capable of multi-temporal QPE observations. A disdrometer architecture that addresses this challenge is presented in this paper. The proposed multi-temporal disdrometer incorporates a computing payload for storing QPE related data at multiple epochs. Performance evaluation shows that the use of the proposed multi-temporal disdrometer in QPE related data acquisition increases data suitable for QPE related modelling by up to 52.2% and 49.4% in the short term and long term respectively.","","978-1-7281-6770-1","10.1109/icABCD49160.2020.9183847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9183847","Remote Sensing;Quantitative Precipitation Estimation;Disdrometer Networks;Size of modelling data;Disdrometers","Rain;Attenuation;Wireless networks;Estimation;Computer architecture;Earth;Data models","atmospheric measuring apparatus;atmospheric techniques;data acquisition;intelligent networks;rain","disdrometer networks;qualitative precipitation estimation;rain-induced attenuation;disdrometer observations;intelligent wireless networks;QPE parameters;spatial variability;multitemporal QPE observations;disdrometer architecture;multitemporal disdrometer;QPE related data;future intelligent networks;multitemporal data acquisition;Performance evaluation","","","","19","IEEE","1 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When only building changes are of interest, both the multi-temporal images and Digital Surface Models provide valuable but not comprehensive information in the change detection procedure. Therefore, in this paper, belief functions have been adopted for fusing information from these two sources. In the first step, two change indicators are proposed by focusing on building changes. Both indicators have been projected to a sigmoid curve, in which both the concordance and discordance indexes are considered. In order to fuse the concordance and discordance indexes and further fuse the two change indicators, two belief functions are considered. One is the original Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST), and the most recent one is Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT). This paper shows how these belief-based frameworks can help in building change detection problem. Besides using different belief functions in obtaining the global BBAs, four decision-making criteria are tested to extract final building change masks. The results have been validated by compared to the manually extracted change reference mask.","2334-0932","978-1-4799-6652-3","10.1109/JURSE.2015.7120482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7120482","","Fuses","buildings (structures);decision making;geophysical image processing;image fusion;inference mechanisms;stereo image processing;uncertainty handling","satellite stereo imagery;belief function;3D building change detection;image quality;computer science;digital surface model;multitemporal imaging;sigmoid curve;discordance index;concordance index;Dempster-Shafer theory;DST;Dezert-Smarandache theory;DSmT;belief-based framework;global BBA;decision-making criteria;change reference mask extraction","","6","","16","IEEE","11 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The OCSRC method is adapted from the classical multi-class sparse representation classifier (SRC) from an earlier work. Based on the spectral based OCSRC, the spectral-spatial OCSRC is brought up by applying the spatial-spectral features to the one class sparse representation process instead of the original spectral bands. The spectral-spatial features discussed in this paper includes Gabor filter, adaptive weighted filter (AWF) and collaborative representation filter (CRF). These features are calculated from the original image with a convolution process to combine the information from the neighboring pixels. Performances of OCSRC with these three features and original spectral feature are tested and compared with multi-temporal multispectral HJ-1A images acquired in Heilongjiang province before and after the flood in 2013, with detailed discussion with two sub-images and massive application with the entire image. Receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) curve, which is widely used to evaluate accuracy for two class problems such as target detection, is employed to evaluate the results. It shows that OCSRC combined with spatial and temporal characteristics outperform the cases with only spectral feature by a lower false positive rate (FPR) at defined true positive rate (TPR), namely less detection errors, and lead to better change detection result.","","978-1-5386-6642-5","10.1109/EORSA.2018.8598610","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8598610","Change detection;one class sparse representation classifier;sparse representation;spatial-spectral features;disaster monitoring","Gabor filters;Feature extraction;Floods;Band-pass filters;Remote sensing;Green products;Adaptive filters","feature extraction;Gabor filters;image classification;image filtering;image representation;object detection;sensitivity analysis","multitemporal multispectral HJ-1A images;change detection result;temporal characteristics;spatial characteristics;class problems;original spectral feature;collaborative representation filter;spectral-spatial features;original spectral bands;class sparse representation process;spectral-spatial OCSRC;classical multiclass sparse representation classifier;OCSRC method;multitemporal change detection problem;one-class sparse representation classifier method;spatial-spectral features","","4","","5","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Determination of olive trees, which are expanded all around Aegean and}{Mediterranean regions of the country, is critical to assess the production capacity and the quality of products. In this study, combinations of time series of Sentinel-1 satellite images, Sentinel-2 satellite images and NDVI products obtained from Sentinel-2 satellite images are used to investigate the classification accuracy of olive trees. According to analysis results, a significant correlation with R2 = 0.67 found between NDVI and SAR data (sigma nought VH/VV in decibel scale). This result pointed out probable accuracy improvement in classification of fused data from different sensors.

Since Fujian has a mountainous terrain and subtropical climate, it is challenging to acquire cloud-free remote sensing images to extract land information from remote sensing images. This study investigates the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to monitor farmland changes from remote sensing images, and Geographical Detectors to analyze the underlying driving factors in the Fujian province. We trained an online Deep Neural Network (DNN) model via Google Colaboratory, and then applied to it classify land-use types from Landsat images during 2000-2020 derived from the GEE platform. The obtained changes of land-use types were then inputted to Geographical Detectors, integrated with population, meteorological, and socio-economic data, to analyze their driving forces. The results showed that the proposed method produced land use maps at intervals of three years with higher overall accuracy (0.91±0.01). Based upon Geographical Detectors, we found that the farmland changes mainly caused by factors regarding elevation, population and slope, followed by factors of soil type, temperature and gross domestic product (GDP). We conclude that the GEE platform combined with deep learning models is of high potential to extract land cover and multi-temporal land use maps over large regions, and the Geographical Detectors are suitable for analyzing land changes using remote sensing derived products.","","978-1-7281-6561-5","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics50104.2021.9530296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530296","Farmland changes;Google Earth Engine (GEE);Deep Neural Networks (DNNs);Geographical detectors","Earth;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Sociology;Detectors;Internet;Statistics","geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;remote sensing;terrain mapping","Google Earth Engine;Geographical Detectors;farmland changes;Fujian province;cloud-free remote sensing images;land information;underlying driving factors;online Deep Neural Network model;Google Colaboratory;classify land-use types;Landsat images;GEE platform;land cover;multitemporal land use maps;land changes;remote sensing derived products","","","","10","IEEE","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the preliminary examination, we observed that DInSAR analysis using multi-temporal TerraSAR-X (TSX), X-band SAR images, is subject to unwrapping errors in the second island. On the other hand, the analysis using multi-temporal Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) / Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Rader-2 (PALSAR2) images was found to include errors in estimating local subsidence velocity.

This paper demonstrates use of an integrated earth observation system (EOS) for mapping and monitoring major agricultural production systems. The approach uses multi-temporal and multi-scale remote sensing data coupled with in-situ observation to map the legume and cereal production systems. The support vector machine (SVM) classification was found to be the best with overall classification accuracy of 82%. The in-situ data on crop grain and straw yields were measured using nested sampling approach. The best fit equation of yield values were regressed with remote sensing indices (NDVI and EVI). The significant correlation (R2) value of cereal and lentil crop were 0.74 and 6.9 at p<;0.01 respectively. The R2 value between observed yield and predicted yield was 0.80 and 0.97 in cereal and lentil crops respectively.

This means the feature space used for the classification is very important in the procedure of change detection. To build an effective discriminative subspace for the change detection of SAR images, a two-stage based SAR change detection algorithm was proposed in this paper. Specifically, for the difference map obtained from two SAR images (before and after change), K-means clustering method was firstly adopted for the subspace dividing, while Principle Component Analysis method was adopted consequently for the construction of the subspace. Then, using the obtained subspace, the neighborhood of each confused pixel in the difference map was projected and re-classified with K-means method to obtain the final change map. In the experiments, using synthetic two-temporal speckled images, the parameters of our method were firstly analyzed in detail. Then, using one real two-temporal SAR images, the performance of our method was further analyzed and compared with some classical methods. The experimental results show that, due to the usage of subspace division and construction, a more reasonable result was achieved by our method.","","978-1-5386-6642-5","10.1109/EORSA.2018.8598549","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8598549","Change Detection;Clustering;Subspace;Multi-temporal SAR Images","","image classification;image processing;pattern clustering;principal component analysis;radar imaging;speckle;synthetic aperture radar","subspace dividing;clustering method;two-stage based SAR change detection algorithm;effective discriminative subspace;changed portion;classification-embedded subspace;subspace division;classical methods;two-temporal SAR images;two-temporal speckled images;final change map;difference map;Principle Component Analysis method","","","","19","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We study the deformation of Sinabung volcano using ALOS/PALSAR interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images acquired from Feb. 2007 to Jan. 2011. Based on multi-temporal InSAR processing, we have mapped the ground surface deformation before, during, and after the 2010 eruption. During the 3 years before the 2010 eruption, the volcano inflated at an average rate ∼1.7 cm/yr with marked higher rate of 6.6 cm/year during the 6 months prior to the 2010 eruption. The inflation is constrained to the top of the volcano. Since the 2010 eruption to Jan. 2011, the volcano has subsided for about 3 cm. The observed inflation and deflation are modeled with a Mogi and Prolate spheroid source. The source of inflation is located about 0.3–1.3 km below sea level directly underneath the crater. On the other hand, deflation source is modeled about 0.6–1.0 km depth with coeruption period. The average volumetric change was about from −2.7×10−5 to 1.9×10−6 km3/yr during the deformation event. Modified Laharz model compare to Landsat-7 ETM+ image through supervised classification method. We interpret the inflation was due to magma accumulation at a shallow reservoir beneath Sinabung. Pyroclastic flow's inundation area is highly matched between two different methods with about 86 % common region inserting for deflation pattern of volume by Mogi model.","2153-7003","978-1-4799-7929-5","10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326902","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7326902","Sinabung volcano;ALOS PALSAR;Landsat-7 ETM+;GIS;Pyroclastic flow","Volcanoes;Satellites;Remote sensing;Earth;Earthquakes;Synthetic aperture radar;Surface treatment","geographic information systems;magma","Mt.

The Multi-Temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) method with the use of a Small Baseline approach was performed due to nature of the deformation process. The LOS observations were decomposed into vertical and azimuth look direction (ALD) components for the double-geometry of the satellite. Vertical displacements up to −321 mm/y and displacement in ALD from −219 mm/y to +125 mm/y have been detected. The correlation between horizontal displacements and the vertical displacements in the subsidence trough was performed for three functions: through the origin, linear, and polynomial 2nd degree. The obtained correlation coefficient R2 has the following values: 0.57, 0.68, and 0.74 respectively. The results can be used to better modeling of the displacement field by taking into account the non-linear relationship between the horizontal displacement and the slopes of the subsidence trough.

Different from normal change detection, hyperspectral anomaly change detection (HACD) helps to find those small but important anomaly changes between multitemporal hyperspectral images (HSI). In previous works, most classical methods use linear regression to establish the mapping relationship between two HSIs and then detect the anomalies from the residual image. However, the real spectral differences between multi-temporal HSIs are likely to be quite complex and of nonlinearity, leading to the limited performance of these linear predictors. In this article, we propose an original HACD algorithm based on autoencoder (ACDA) to give a nonlinear solution. The proposed ACDA can construct an effective predictor model when facing complex imaging conditions. In the ACDA model, two siamese autoencoder networks are deployed to construct two predictors from two directions. The predictor is used to model the spectral variation of the background to obtain the predicted image under another imaging condition. Then the mean square error between the predictive image and corresponding expected image is computed to obtain the loss map, where the spectral differences of the unchanged pixels are highly suppressed and anomaly changes are highlighted. Ultimately, we take the minimum of the two loss maps of two directions as the final anomaly change intensity map. The experiments results on public “Viareggio 2013” datasets demonstrate the efficiency and superiority over traditional methods.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3066508","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971317,61822113); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2020CFB594,2018CFA050); National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2018YFA0605500); Science and Technology Major Project of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2019AEA170); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9380336","Anomaly change detection;autoencoder (AE);feature extraction;hyperspectral image (HSI)","Feature extraction;Hyperspectral imaging;Predictive models;Imaging;Decoding;Training;Image reconstruction","geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image coding;object detection;regression analysis","spectral differences;hyperspectral anomaly change detection;autoencoder;hyperspectral imaging technology;hyperspectral data;normal change detection;multitemporal hyperspectral images;residual image;complex imaging conditions;predicted image;imaging condition;predictive image;spectral information;geological survey;vegetation analysis;military reconnaissance;HACD","","16","","46","CCBYNCND","17 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As for the Landsat data, great advances have been made on detecting cloud and cloud shadow. However, few studies were performed on Landsat cloud removal for large areas. To facilitate land cover dynamics studies with high temporal resolution, we present an automatic cloud removal algorithm in this paper. Specifically, For Landsat Collection 1 Level-1 surface reflectance products, the algorithm first builds a cloud mask from the Quality Assessment (QA) band, and then reconstructs cloud-contaminated portions based on multi-temporal Landsat images with temporal similarity. To further eliminate radiation differences between cloud-free and reconstructed regions, a Poisson blending algorithm is adopted. Besides, the efficiency of gradient-domain compositing is accelerated by the quad-tree approach. Experiments have been performed to process more than 50,000 Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images covering China from 2013 to 2017, which yield promising results in terms of radiometric accuracy and consistency for experimental images with cloud coverage less than 80%. The produced Landsat time series images with cloud removal can be further used for analyzing land cover and land change dynamics in China, and the proposed algorithm should be easily employed to produce cloud-free Landsat time series for other areas.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2979291","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41601384,41971396,41701399,41401421); Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDA19080301); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9027889","Cloud removal;Landsat Collection 1;Poisson blending","Clouds;Remote sensing;Earth;Artificial satellites;Time series analysis;Reflectivity;Heuristic algorithms","clouds;geophysical image processing;image resolution;land cover;radiometry","China;AD 2013 to 2017;radiometric accuracy;quad-tree approach;gradient-domain;radiation differences;quality assessment band;land cover dynamics studies;Landsat cloud removal;detecting cloud;data archive;optical satellite imagery;cloud shadow;multitemporal Landsat data automatic cloud removal;cloud-free Landsat time series;land change dynamics;Landsat time series images;cloud coverage;Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager images;Poisson blending algorithm;temporal similarity;multitemporal Landsat images;cloud-contaminated portions;cloud mask;Landsat Collection 1 Level-1 surface reflectance products;automatic cloud removal algorithm;high temporal resolution","","7","","26","CCBY","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The fusion of images is used for integrating the complementary multi-temporal, multi-view, and multi-sensor information into a single image with improved image quality and by keeping the integrity of essential features. It is considered a vital pre-processing phase for several applications such as robot vision, aerial, satellite imaging, medical imaging, and robot or vehicle guidance. This paper proposed an enhancement image compression algorithm on a discrete cosine transform (DCT). Then it uses the DCT transformation in the remote sensing image fusion domain and a remote sensing image fusion method with an improved proposed algorithm. The method in this paper has an acceptable compromise between enhancing the spatial resolution of the fused image and maintaining the spectral information. Besides, it is shown that there is no need for codec operations when performing image fusion in the compressed domain such as JPEG. This reduces the time to obtain the fused image and effectively suppresses the problem of dealing with blocky image processing; blockage often occurs. Furthermore, the improved algorithm has better spectral retention capability under the premise of more explicit fusion images and is more suitable for applications requiring higher spectral fidelity.","","978-1-6654-9563-9","10.1109/ICSIP55141.2022.9887300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9887300","Image Fusion;DCT;Multi-Spectral Image (MSI);Panchromatic image (PAN)","Image coding;Satellites;Transform coding;Signal sampling;Sensor fusion;Sensors;Discrete cosine transforms","data compression;discrete cosine transforms;image coding;image enhancement;image fusion;image processing;image resolution;medical image processing;remote sensing;robot vision;sensor fusion","discrete cosine transform;high compression;single compound image;complementary multitemporal;multiview;multisensor information;single image;improved image quality;vital pre-processing phase;satellite imaging;medical imaging;enhancement image compression algorithm;DCT transformation;remote sensing image fusion domain;remote sensing image fusion method;fused image;blocky image processing;explicit fusion images","","","","15","IEEE","19 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the context of an increasing availability of both optical and SAR images, thank to the Sentinel constellation, we propose a deep learning method to reconstruct (gap-fill) optical data, polluted by cloud phenomena, exploiting multi-temporal SAR and optical images.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8900353","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8900353","Deep Learning;Gap filling;SAR images;Optical images","Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Optical network units;Radar polarimetry;Convolution;Training;Optical computing","geophysical image processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);optical images;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","optical image gap;deep convolutional autoencoder;optical radar images;optical imagery;cloud-free scenes;specific date;operational monitoring applications;cloud-insensitive SAR sensors;orthogonal information;optical satellite;optical images;cloud cover;optical SAR images;deep learning method;optical data;cloud phenomena","","3","","14","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here, a simplified first-order radiative transfer equation for use in retrieval algorithms is proposed. The inclusion of first-order scattering increases sensitivity to soil moisture especially for wet surfaces. The recently developed multi-temporal dual channel algorithm (MT-DCA) is implemented over Africa using both the τ-ω model and the proposed first-order equation with SMAP 36 km gridded brightness temperature measurements as inputs. The algorithm finds large changes in soil moisture mean and standard deviation in areas with woody vegetation and little change elsewhere.

The Interferometric SAR coherence allows discriminating false alarms caused by other land cover classes characterized by high backscattering values which are not coherent in time (e.g. certain types of vegetated areas).

This paper explores this literature and evaluates the feasibility of such methods applied to crop classification in a tropical region from multi-temporal SAR image sequences.

An approach of compensating the positioning shift is proposed based on rigorous projection models of RADARSAT-2. Experimental results illustrate that the positioning error of a static target which is derived using SCW products with different GTHs is 446.63m.

The NDVI products obtained from these three sensors were validated and compared with land cover and land use map of the same area for visual interpretation. The main results of this study showed that the NDVI in the mid-2010 was low within area-of-the interests in the vicinity of the nuclear power plant, but the vegetated area continued to expand until 2021. It can be interpreted as a result of a decrease in human activities. In particular, the map of differences between the mid-2010 and 2021 of high-resolution images revealed detailed spatial features rather than those of the mid-resolution images. In disaster areas where access is restricted, such as the areas around the Fukushima nuclear power plant, and where it is difficult to collect field data, obtaining classification products with high accuracy using satellite images is challenging.

The RF algorithm was subsequently trained based on 60% of the data, and validated using the remaining data. Results show that the crop phenology can be monitored, through the combination of multiple polarimetric parameters to build different decision trees in the RF algorithm. By averaging the estimates from multiple decision trees, the complex relative patterns between the polarimetric parameters and crop phenology were recognized, leading to appropriate estimations on crop phenology.

This study was able to find the unique displacement pattern, which is called as a deflection. The deflection is commonly caused by the creep, shrinkage, and ageing. Due to the early stage after the completion of the construction, the physical change of the bridge characteristics leads to the deflection.

Reconstructing the original signal from the missing data is an essential task of a multi-temporal image analysis to monitor dynamic phenomena, e.g. crop growth and phenology, weather/climate changes, disaster evolution, land use/cover change, and others. Generally, two operations are performed: 1. identification of the cloudy pixels (generation of a cloud mask); 2. reconstruction with cloud-free pixels, derived or estimated from past/future cloud-free acquisitions (e.g. generation of a composite image). This article presents a review of the main cloud detection methods and discusses advantages and disadvantages of the replacement of cloudy pixels with cloud-free ones. We propose a new smoothing function; it performs the above two steps in one-pass operation thus simplifying the processing chain.

These dynamics could, in principle, be exploited to classify different types of crops. Thus, this study aims to investigate methodologies and results of crop type classification making use of phenological information extracted from high spatial resolution satellite imagery. Vegetation indices (VI) retrieved from Sentinel-2 imagery are evaluated to track the year-round vegetation behavior. Starting from a multi-temporal image series of the same scene, the phenological profiles can be extracted and introduced into a supervised classification process to detect crop fields, discriminating among different species. Following this, we propose a cross-correlation based model that, using a priori information from ground training data, searches for the best matching phenology. When compared to machine learning models for crop classification, the one proposed in this study can provide useful information about phenology that can be stored and used for better monitoring spatio-temporal variations of crops species through the future years and guiding agricultural management accordingly. Our case studies are the regions of Bothaville and Harrismith, located in South Africa, and the region of Jendouba in Tunisia. The results for the Bothaville region show 89.19% of user accuracy on the main crop type classification (maize crops). For beans and sorghum, the confusion matrix attests 93% and 74% of accuracy respectively, even if their statistics are less significant due to the limited number of available ground data for secondary crops.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-2792-0","10.1109/IGARSS46834.2022.9884724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9884724","Sentinel-2;agriculture;classification;phenology;cross-correlation","Satellites;Crops;Vegetation mapping;Training data;Machine learning;Data models;Behavioral sciences","agriculture;crops;geophysical image processing;image classification;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing;time series;vegetation;vegetation mapping","cross-correlation phenology-based crop fields classification;Sentinel-2 time-series;agricultural areas;relatively short time intervals;growing season;crop type classification making use;phenological information;high spatial resolution satellite imagery;vegetation indices;Sentinel-2 imagery;year-round vegetation behavior;multitemporal image series;phenological profiles;supervised classification process;cross-correlation based model;matching phenology;machine learning models;crop classification;monitoring spatio-temporal variations;crops species;future years;guiding agricultural management;main crop type classification;maize crops;secondary crops","","","","17","IEEE","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study aims to estimate the AGB of the largest single mangrove forest in the Philippines located in the municipality of Del Carmen, Siargao Islands using remotely sensed Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IfSAR) datasets and Sentinel-1 image. There were three predictor variables derived from the Sentinel -1 image used for modeling the AGB: the backscatter value from VV polarization, backscatter value from VH polarization, and the combination of the backscatter values from VV and VH polarizations. Also, the predictor variable from IfSAR dataset that was used is the canopy height. Linear regression between the field-measured AGB and the predictor variables was used to generate AGB model, and the coefficient of determination (r2) and root mean square error (RMSE) were determined. The results show that the model derived from IfSAR data obtained a coefficient of determination of 0.42 and RMSE of 19.39 Mg/ha. However, the combination of the two polarizations derived from Sentinel-1 image was more accurate in estimating AGB since it obtained the highest r2 of 0.43 and lowest RMSE of 12.65 Mg/ha. Based on the best model the estimated above ground biomass of whole mangrove forest ranged from 73.37 Mg/ha to 225.51 Mg/ha with an average of 140.2 Mg/ha.

The results show that the velocity of the Gulmit Glacier increases with a rising altitude from the glacier terminal. The three other glaciers initially display high velocity, followed by a decrease from the glacier terminal, with the maximum velocity attained in the middle of the glacier. In addition, the Karakoram glaciers produced a slight mass gain, with all mountain glaciers exhibiting clear regional acceleration from 1993-2019. The ice deformation velocity of the Batura Glacier diminished at an average rate of 8.49 %.

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for the change detection from multitemporal SAR images that does not require any speckle filtering. This method is based on: i) generating a multiresolution set of the single-channel log ratio image using stationary wavelet transform (SWT); ii) applying the T-point algorithm for all the images of the multiresolution sets; and iii) fusing the obtained images at the optimum reliable scale to generate the change map.

Evantualy temporal data compression is becoming a critical issue for fast data transmission. Many works have been done regarding compression in the field of satellite images that utilizes the spectral and spatial redundancies using predictive and transformed based procedures for lossless data compression, but, most of the contributions are on individual data or on single data. The main objective of this paper is to exploit the temporal correlation between the images. The recent image will be predicted from the historical image that is already available to the user. This will substantially reduce the load in transmitting the images. This paper actually emphasis on the process of increasing temporal correlation, which consequently improves the compression gain.

During past decades, a series of effective change detection techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Change Vector Analysis (CVA) and Post Classification Comparison (PCC), have been developed to observe the LULC vicissitudes. All aforesaid techniques performed very well in some situations such as on horizontal land but very rarely experimented on rugged terrain satellite imagery because change detection procedures are very problematic for such study areas. From this perspective, this study comprises the quantitative analysis of different change detection techniques to study LULC changes linked with rugged terrain Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor satellite imagery. In addition to this, necessary pre-processing steps such as geometric correction, radiometric correction and topographic correction for flat surface as well as rugged terrain, have also been summarized to correct the estimated spectral reflectance value. Experiment outcomes confirms that CVA technique has greater potential (achieved accuracy assessment of 90% with Kappa coefficient of 0.8838) than PCC and PCA techniques (achieved accuracy assessment of 78-82% with Kappa coefficient of 0.6358-0.7537, respectively) to analyzed the overall transformed information over rugged terrain MODIS satellite imagery. It is projected that this will efficiently guide the natural hazard forecaster's or algorithm engineer's to precisely perceive the multi-temporal environment changes over Land-Use/Land-Cover rugged terrain.","","978-1-4799-6761-2","10.1109/ICSPCom.2015.7150661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7150661","Principal Component Analysis (PCA);Change Vector Analysis (CVA);Post Classification Comparison (PCC);Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS);Topographic correction","Principal component analysis;Satellites;Remote sensing;Satellite broadcasting;Accuracy;Soil;MODIS","computational geometry;geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;land use;principal component analysis;radiometry;remote sensing;terrain mapping","change detection algorithms;rugged terrain MODIS sensor satellite imagery;Earth surface change detection;land-use-land-cover monitoring;LULC monitoring;principal component analysis;PCA;change vector analysis;CVA;post classification comparison;PCC;LULC vicissitudes;moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensor satellite imagery;geometric correction;radiometric correction;topographic correction;spectral reflectance value estimation;Kappa coefficient;natural hazard forecaster","","5","","42","IEEE","9 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, in this paper, a very simple and effective change detection technique based on mutual information (MI), which is used as a similarity measure tool between two variables in statistics, is proposed. Herein, spatial neighborhood information around each pixel is exploited to get the MI and corresponding features. Further, difference feature vectors are created in feature space that provides discriminant information for change detection task. These difference feature vectors from all bands of multispectral images are concatenated to get the final feature vectors. Finally, features are classified by applying hard and soft clustering techniques i.e. k-means and fuzzy c-means, respectively and the results by both the clustering algorithms are compared.

The disastrous bush fire event occurred during November 2019, and lasted until February 2020, destroying more than 46 million acres of land. Burn area mapping is a major parameter in carrying out mitigation measures and regrowth activities by forest officials or fire managers post fire event. In this study, multi-temporal satellite datasets such as images acquired from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat-8 (L8) missions are used to map the burn areas. Two thematic indices such as Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR) are implemented on the study area. The entire analysis, i.e., accessing the datasets, preprocessing, and calculation of indices for brunt area mapping is carried out on Google Earth Engine cloud platform. Rather than ground survey, the active fire product VIIRS product (VNP14IMGTDL) is used as a proxy for the actual fire indices in accuracy assessment. Results revealed that RBR showed better accuracy than dNBR for both the datasets (S2 and L8). S2 burn severity maps of dNBR and RBR showed better accuracy than L8 burn severity maps because of S2 having a higher spatial resolution. Thus, S2 datasets can be useful for rapid mapping of burn areas with improved spatial as well as temporal resolution.","","978-1-7281-5970-6","10.1109/ICSIDEMPC49020.2020.9299625","Ministry of Human Resource Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9299625","Sentinel-2;Forest fires;Rapid Mapping;Google Earth Engine","Remote sensing;Earth;Forestry;Vegetation mapping;Satellites;Spatial resolution;Artificial satellites","fires;geophysical image processing;remote sensing;vegetation;vegetation mapping;wildfires","Burn area mapping;Google Earth Engine cloud platform;2019 forest fires;eastern Australia;rainforests;disastrous bush fire event;forest officials;fire managers;multitemporal satellite datasets;Sentinel-2;Landsat-8 missions;burn areas;brunt area mapping;active fire product VIIRS product;actual fire indices;S2 burn severity maps;L8 burn severity maps;rapid mapping","","","","25","IEEE","1 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The MHYSAN model was calibrated using seven very high-resolution SAR (TerraSAR-X) SM outputs ranging over only two months. Then, the simulated SM was validated using continuous thetaprobe measurements during 15 months. The high performances observed could be explained by the fact that although images were acquired during a short time range, the important soil moisture variation captured allowed a good calibration of the soil parameters.

Recent geothermal and geochemical studies suggest that the TVG is dormant-active rather than extinct, implying the eruption potential to devastate the nearby area of 7 million inhabitants. Although some geodetic tools (e.g., global positioning system and precise leveling) have been utilized to analyze the activity associated with volcanism, it is still challenging for conventional interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique to obtain clear ground surface movement at the TVG due to decorrelation and complex atmospheric delay. In this study, we present an improved multi-temporal InSAR (MTInSAR) approach to explore the temporal evolution and spatial extent of displacement at the TVG from 19 L-band ALOS/PALSAR images acquired between 2007 and 2011. Stratified atmospheric delays and orbit error are corrected with a patch-based joint model as different phase components can be separated according to their distinct spatiotemporal characteristics. The spatial deformation patterns indicate an uplift of 10 mm/year at the SW-NE ridge and subsidence with a rate of 10 mm/year at the E-W ridge. The temporal deformation variations at Mt. Chihshin and Huangzuei have high similarity with correlation coefficients of 0.9 above. This indicates that the subsidence at Mts.

Among various technologies, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been successfully applied in urban settlement mapping in the past two decades. Although much effort with varying degrees of success has been made in previous studies, the research work is still ongoing, and three challenges should be highlighted. First, the effect of de-speckling is usually underestimated, to the extent that the improvement of the SAR image quality is totally ignored in some studies. Second, a method that combines full Interferometric SAR (InSAR) information is as yet missing. Third, training samples are generally required to process SAR images to extract urban settlements, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, or even impractical when classifying satellite data at the regional/global scale. To address these issues, this paper presents an automatic method for urban settlement mapping trained by multi-temporal InSAR using social media. To improve the detection performance and reduce false alarm ratio, intensity and coherence are first accurately estimated without loss of image resolution by homogeneous pixel selection and robust estimators. The homogeneous pixels will be also applied to measure urban characteristics from the geometrical prospective. After that, training samples are automatically generated from social media based on the fact that cities and urban areas are nowadays full of individual geo-referenced data such as social network data Finally, these multiple information sources will be fused to extract urban areas based on an improved one class classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in extracting urban areas with good accuracy. This study provides a new de-speckling means to process multi-temporal InSAR and sheds new light on the applications of social media in the field of remote sensing.","1559-9450","978-4-8855-2316-8","10.23919/PIERS.2018.8597712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8597712","","Social network services;Training;Feature extraction;Coherence;Synthetic aperture radar;Urban areas;Data mining","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image resolution;land use;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;social networking (online);synthetic aperture radar","urbanization process;Synthetic Aperture Radar;SAR image quality;Interferometric SAR information;SAR images;multitemporal InSAR;social media;urban characteristics;urban areas;social network data;automatic urban settlement mapping;satellite data;despeckling;remote sensing;image resolution","","","","9","","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, the operational value of crop status maps derived from remotely sensed data would be much higher if there was no need for re-parametrization of the approach for different situations. In this study, we derived GGC maps for cereals by using a modified approach that does not rely on empirical relationships. To test the accuracy of this approach, a field study was conducted on three dates during the growing season of 2014 in the central Ukraine to collect ground cover reference data from seven agricultural fields containing winter wheat and barley. The final map provides an absolute measure of crop GGC at any point in the field, allowing for direct monitoring of growth dynamics derived from multi-temporal images. A high coefficient of determination (R2) of 84% was obtained for the relationship between estimated and observed GGC of the seasonally pooled data set with a mean absolute error of 8.7%, suggesting that the values of GGC predicted were on average within a range of 9% of their true value.","","978-1-4673-8087-4","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2015.7248153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7248153","Ground Cover;RapidEye;Spatial Variability;Precision Agriculture","Soil;Agriculture;Reflectivity;Estimation;Vegetation mapping;Accuracy;Remote sensing","crops;geophysical image processing;land cover;vegetation mapping","crop growth dynamics;cereals;high-resolution RapidEye imagery;vegetation index;green ground cover fraction;spatial estimation;canopy characteristics;remote sensing imagery;operational production;GGC map;crop status map;remotely sensed data;growing season;ground cover reference data;agricultural field;winter wheat;barley;multitemporal image;mean absolute error","","","","17","IEEE","10 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Feature stacking is the most commonly used method of data fusion but does not consider the heterogeneity of multimodal optical images and OSM data, which becomes its main drawback. The proposed framework processes two data sources separately and then combines them at the model level through two fusion models (the landuse fusion model and building fusion model) that aim to fuse optical images with landuse and buildings layers of OSM data, respectively. In addition, a new approach to detecting building incompleteness of OSM data is proposed. The proposed framework was trained and tested using the data from the 2017 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest and further validated on one additional test (AT) set containing test samples that are manually labeled in Munich and New York. The experimental results have indicated that compared with the feature stacking-based baseline framework, the proposed framework is effective in fusing optical images with OSM data for the classification of LCZs with high generalization capability on a large scale. The classification accuracy of the proposed framework outperforms the baseline framework by more than 6% and 2% while testing on the test set of 2017 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest and the AT set, respectively. In addition, the proposed framework is less sensitive to spectral diversities of optical satellite images and thus achieves more stable classification performance than the state-of-the-art frameworks.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2914967","H2020 European Research Council(grant numbers:ERC-2016-StG-714087); Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft(grant numbers:VH-NG-1018); Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8765334","Canonical correlation forest (CCF);heterogeneous data fusion;local climate zones (LCZs);OpenStreetMap (OSM);satellite images","Satellites;Urban areas;Data integration;Meteorology;Artificial neural networks;Training;Radio frequency","geophysical image processing;geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;image classification;image fusion;pattern classification;remote sensing;sensor fusion;terrain mapping","data sources;fusion models;landuse fusion model;building fusion model;OSM data;2017 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest;feature stacking-based baseline framework;optical satellite images;heterogeneous earth observation Data;local climate zones;multispectral satellite images;multimodal optical images","","18","","44","OAPA","17 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper provides a solution for removal of the registration errors automatically for multi temporal and multi resolution imagery, hence facilitating Automatic Image co-registration. Feature extraction utilizes the SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features). Feature matching is done using Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbours (FLANN) matcher. The work focuses on solving the problems faced in matching of valid key point descriptors of the sensed and reference imagery, particularly the panchromatic satellite imagery.

The glaciers are melting faster than expected which has resulted in global mean sea level rise and increased the risk of floods. The development of modern remote sensing technology has made it possible to obtain images more frequently than ever before. On the other side, the availability of high-performance computing hardware and processing techniques have made it possible to provide a cost-effective solution to monitor the temporal changes of glaciers at a large scale. In this study, supervised machine learning methods are investigated for automatic classification of glacier covers from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery using texture, topographic, and spectral data. Three most commonly used supervised machine learning techniques were investigated: support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF). The proposed method was employed on the data obtained from Passu watershed in Hunza Basin located along the Hunza river in Pakistan. Three main classes were considered: glaciers, debris-covered glaciers and non-glaciated areas. The data was split into training (70%) and testing datasets (30%). Finally, an area-based accuracy assessment was performed by comparing the results obtained for each classifier with the reference data. Experiments showed that the results produced for all classifiers were highly accurate and visually more consistent with the depiction of glacier cover types. For all experiments, random forest performed the best (Kappa = 0.95, f-measure = 95.06%) on all three classes compared to ANN (Kappa = 0.92, f-measure = 92.05) and SVM (Kappa = 0.89, f-measure = 91.86% on average).

A comparative analysis of the two methods shows that the Asymmetric Gaussian function fitting is more suitable for a single season. The Savitzky-Golay filtering is more sensitive, and there are many pseudo-peaks in the fitted curve, resulting in a large extraction result compared with verification data. The twice Savitzky-Golay filtering further smooths the curve and removes a large number of false peaks, which is more suitable for the vegetation characteristics of paddy fields in Guangdong Province; The paddy field planting area is highly correlated with the rice planting area, but there are rice-peanut, rice-sweet potato and rice-sweet sugarcane planting patterns in the paddy field.

Recent algorithms (SqueeSAR, CAESAR, and PD-PSInSAR) claim to jointly process PS and DS. SqueeSAR algorithm applies a threshold based on the statistically homogenous pixels (SHP), which prevents only the PS pixels having single-bounce scatterer from inclusion in DS processing, but the remaining types of PS pixels cannot be preserved. The included PS pixels lose their coherent information during phase history optimization in DS processing. In this paper, a new measure, the similar time-series interferometric phase (STIP) pixel is used for the identification of brotherhood pixels, which improves the classification of interferometric pixels and coherence estimation. The application of STIP instead of SHP significantly improves the phase optimization efficiency of DS pixels while retaining valuable information of PS more effectively. Furthermore, to optimize the interferometric phase of DS pixels, a least squares model is developed, which is more time efficient as compared to the Maximum likelihood estimators of the conventional DS processing techniques.

The data assimilation method which combined crop growth model and multi-source observed data has been proven to be the most effective method to simulate the crop growth process and predict crop yields. Based on the observed LAI, the time-series LAI data sets were obtained by using the smooth unequally spaced interpolation. With the support of amount of related data, the crop model of Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)-Wheat can be used to simulate the growth of the winter wheat, and the particle filtering-based data assimilation strategy also could be implemented to improve the CERES-Wheat simulation process. Through the assimilation strategy, the incorporation between the observed and modeled LAIs was performed under the dynamic framework of the winter wheat growth process such that the LAI simulation was sequentially optimized, which led to optimal yield estimation. Comparing the measured the data with the assimilation and no assimilation results, it obvious showed that the yield estimations were dramatically improved after assimilation. Then considering the influence of the observed leaf area index on the assimilation process at multi-temporal scale, this paper try to analysis the uncertainty of the assimilation results from three aspects of temporal scale: First, Assimilating the observed LAI data at five kinds of temporal resolution (2-day, 4-day, 8-day, 16-day, 32-day), the results showed that the accuracy of the yield estimation tended to significantly improve as the temporal resolution of assimilating LAI increased from 32-day to 2-day. In addition, as the increasing of the temporal resolution, the computing time increased dramatically. Second, the observed LAI data was applied to assimilation with the four different stages of crop growth (green-jointing, jointing-heading, heading-mature, green-mature). The results showed that the accuracy of the yield estimation by assimilating the LAI at the stages of the green-mature (the whole growth phase) is the highest, while the accuracy during the stages from the green-jointing is the lowest. And also the accuracy during the stages from jointing-heading is the second highest. Third, the observed LAI data was used to assimilation with synthesizing the temporal resolution and the stages of crop growth (three kinds of temporal resolution (2, 4, 8 day) and four stages of crop growth). The results showed that on the premise of the optimal efficiency and accuracy, the optimal plan is to select observed LAI by using the temporal resolution of 8 day during the stages from jointing-heading. This study will be a better influence on decreasing the calculation time and improving the effect for the crop model data assimilation.","","978-1-4673-8087-4","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2015.7248157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7248157","Crop yield;LAI;data assimilation;CERES-Wheat;particle filtering;multi-temporal","Agriculture;Data assimilation;Data models;Accuracy;Soil;Predictive models;Remote sensing","crops;data assimilation;food safety;particle filtering (numerical methods);time series","crop model data assimilation;particle filter;leaf area index;different temporal scales;crop yield prediction;national food security assessment;food policy making;time-series LAI data sets;crop environment resource synthesis;CERES-wheat;winter wheat;crop growth","","2","","31","IEEE","10 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To our knowledge, no study has explored the ability of remote sensing in detecting and mapping snow damaged vegetation in South Africa. Therefore, this study integrates vegetation indices derived from multi-temporal Landsat 8 imagery with Sparse Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (SPLS-DA) to detect and map snow induced damage to vegetation used for commercial forestry.

The results revealed that the multi-temporal coherence approach has the promising capability to map building damage but is not as accurate for detecting building damage under a vegetation canopy. Meanwhile, the normalized burn ratio (NBR) still provides meaningful damage maps independent of the canopy, however, the accuracy was slightly lower than the multi-temporal coherence approach for the buildings not covered by the canopy.

Primeval forests that remained there untouched have exceptional value. Unsustainable logging and climate change intensify forest disturbances and may cause substantial forest loss. The engagement of remote sensing allows timely monitoring and prediction of negative consequences. The leaf area index is selected from the other forest’s condition indicators to assess the forests’ quantity and disturbance. The conceptual approach for risk assessment of forest disturbance is proposed. This approach uses multiscale multi-temporal Earth observation data, such as synthetic aperture radar imagery and high-level satellite data products. The output response of the forest’s condition was restored by multivariate regression with radar backscattering coefficients, relative difference polarization index, and local incidence angle. The low-resolution leaf area index pre-developed Copernicus data products make it possible to characterize the forest’s condition without ground truth measurements. According to the elaborated methodology, a time series of the leaf area index was mapped, and risks analysis was performed according to hazard functions. A resulting risk’s gradations map is a good tool for future research and decision-making support in nature management.

Currently, IRS-1C/1D georeferenced data products have system level location accuracy go up to 1 Km. In addition, the location error of IRS-1C/1D datasets are increased to many kilometers especially in hilly terrain scenes. Such higher location accuracy error makes legacy IRS-1C/1D data not directly usable for any kind of space borne applications. In this paper, an efficient approach is presented to improve the geo-location accuracy of IRS-1C/1D data by incorporating inflight geometric calibration exercises. The rigorous sensor model is fed with primary image, ancillary orbit and attitude data, digital elevation model (DEM) and a reference image to produce ortho-rectified product. The major challenge is to do automatic feature matching of IRS-1C/1D data with current RS-2A reference image database to achieve sub-pixel level geometric error. As datasets are more than two decades older, the number of outliers in matched feature points are more. Also geo-location error of 1C/1D is varying a lot which makes it difficult to set the search window radius for feature matching. To handle this scenario, mode seeking based pruning mechanism is added with robust SIFT feature matching technique which is independent of search window size. Additionally, SIFT parameters are also fine-tuned to get more stable feature points. The approach developed is tested in many multi temporal IRS-1C/1D LISS-3 datasets. The geo-location error of the products generated is at sub-pixel level accuracy with respect to the reference. The IRS-1C/1D data products generated with this new updated chain can be used directly as analysis ready datasets.","","978-1-7281-4072-8","10.1109/TENGARSS48957.2019.8976048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8976048","IRS-1C/1D;Geometric Calibration;Geo-Location Accuracy;Feature Matching;SIFT","","calibration;digital elevation models;feature extraction;terrain mapping;transforms","geo-location accuracy improvement;historical digital sensor data;Legacy IRS-1C/1D Data Products;change detection analysis;agriculture growth;wetland mapping;urban sprawl monitoring;data cube framework;data analytics;inflight geometric calibration exercises;primary image;ancillary orbit;attitude data;digital elevation model;reference image;ortho-rectified product;automatic feature matching;search window radius;feature matching;mode seeking based pruning mechanism;robust SIFT feature matching technique","","","","8","IEEE","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The application of change detection in remote sensing is considered complicated due to continuous interaction of humans with nature. Further, the change detection in land cover and water bodies plays a major role in global change. Manual change detection process via experts consumes more time to survey the land, whereas detection of changes in land cover and water bodies via an artificial intelligence (AI) model enables faster change detection. However, multi-sensor and multi-temporal satellite data calibration poses a serious problem in remote-sensing application. It makes the entire clustering process a difficult one and hence the accuracy of change detection degrades. In this paper, we apply the task of unsupervised learning to a deep learning model namely deep belief network. Here, the land cover images are clustered using the unlabeled data, where the algorithms are trained in unsupervised manner. The intelligent decisions are made available via deep belief network that clusters the uncategorized the land covers and water bodies images from the satellite image database. The dataset includes Landsat sensors’ datasets in dry semi-arid river basin in Western India.

The contributions of the present paper for the sake of parsimonious analysis of such huge datasets are associated with a framework having two main processing stages. The first stage is the derivation of an index called geometric multi-wavelet total variation for fast and robust anomaly spotting. This index is useful for identifying significant abnormal patterns appearing as geo-spatial non-stationarities in multi-wavelet total variation map. The second stage consists in the proposal of a concise asymmetric multi-date change information matrix on regions associated with significant multi-wavelet total variations.

We also investigated the use of multi-variate conditional copula as a classifier technique, by formulating the change and no-change as a binary-class classification problem in this study. The classification results from the above technique are used for assessment of damage and debris cover after the tornado disaster event. The performance of the above approach yields a very significant Kappa accuracy up to 75%. A 10-fold cross validation strategy is used for quantitative analysis of the performance of the classification model. This study will be further extended for modelling the effect of incidence angle discrepancies or climatic condition variances, which will address the heterogeneity factor in terms of local statistics of the dataset.","2332-5615","978-1-4673-9558-8","10.1109/AIPR.2015.7444537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7444537","change detection;machine learning;conditional Copula;disaster management;data fusion","Tornadoes;Data integration;Spatial resolution;Synthetic aperture radar;Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Disaster management","emergency management;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);radar imaging;remote sensing;sensor fusion;statistical distributions;storms","change detection analysis;tornado disaster management;conditional copula;multisensor data fusion;C-band SAR dataset;RADARSAT-2;NIR;RapidEye;advanced linear imaging;ALI;feature extraction;statistical learning;feature classification","","10","","19","IEEE","31 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mango is a major fruit crop in India, but detection of changes in mango crops remains a challenging task because the reason that many perennial crops have similar reflectance profiles. Therefore, a potent change detection technique is required for different applications such as the rate of deforestation, urban developments, damage evaluation, and resource monitoring. Compared to annual and seasonal crops, relatively few studies have been conducted on change detection in perennial fruit crops. In this study, a novel log ratio change detection technique (i.e., LR-PCA) is developed using the fusion of log-ratio (LR) and principal component analysis (PCA) images derived from bi-temporal soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) images to extract meaningful information and detect temporal changes in the mango fruit crop areas with high change detection accuracy. The proposed approach comprised two steps: (1) SAVI images from 2015 and 2019 were used to retrieve the log-ratio (LR) and principal component (PC) images, respectively, and both the images were fused by applying the pixel-by-pixel fusion approach. (2) Fused images were classified into three classes: “positive change”, “no change”, and “negative change” using a derived threshold value. The results show that the LR-PCA method of change detection yields a high change detection accuracy of 92% in comparison with the other change detection methods viz. vegetation image differencing, image ratioing, PCA, and log-ratio. To validate the adaptability of the proposed algorithm, experiments with two sets of bi-temporal SAVI indices images belonging to the Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh State determine that the proposed change detection method performs well as compared to the existing individual methods for detection of changes in mango fruit crop. The proposed method is expected to be useful for detecting changes in the area of perennial crops. In the future, an accurate and efficient change detection analysis may be helpful for developing a real-time mango fruit crop monitoring system at the national level.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3194000","University Kembangan Malaysia(grant numbers:FRGS/1/2020/ICT03/UKM/02/6); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9840352","Landsat 8 OLI;change detection;log ratio;principal component analysis;mango crop","Crops;Earth;Principal component analysis;Remote sensing;Artificial satellites;Vegetation mapping;Satellite broadcasting","crops;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;image fusion;principal component analysis;remote sensing;soil","LR-PCA method;image ratioing;log-ratio;real-time mango fruit crop monitoring system;Landsat 8 OLI images;multitemporal satellite images;annual crops;seasonal crops;mango fruit crop areas;bitemporal soil adjusted vegetation index images;pixel-by-pixel fusion;Sitapur district;Uttar Pradesh State;India;AD 2015;AD 2019","","1","","43","CCBY","26 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, with an increasing spatial resolution of SAR data, the external DEM is becoming less qualified for this purpose, resulting in notable phase residues and even decorrelation in differential interferograms. Although topographic residuals can be parameterized and estimated by multi-temporal InSAR (MTInSAR) techniques, its accuracy is limited by several factors. Instead of providing accurate height information, shortening the length of baselines is an alternative for DEM phase mitigation. We propose here an MTInSAR processing framework that can retrieve the deformation time series without the estimation of topographic residuals. Within the framework, we generate a set of pseudo interferograms with near-zero baselines by integer combination and take these pseudo interferograms as observations of MTInSAR model, where deformation becomes the only signal that needs to be parameterized. The deformation time series is then retrieved directly from wrapped phases by ridge estimation with an integer ambiguity detector. It is noted that although atmospheric artifacts might be magnified during the combination, their differential components at arcs constructed with neighboring points that are not significantly enlarged. The proposed method is particularly suitable for infrastructure deformation monitoring in urban areas where no accurate external DEM is available. It also has promising potential for retrieving deformation from SAR data stacks with short acquisition intervals since the combination can enlarge the signal of interests in pseudo-observations. Semisynthetic and real data tests indicate that the proposed method has satisfied performance on DEM error mitigation and deformation time series estimation.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2925115","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41774023,41304011,41701535); Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee(grant numbers:PolyU 152232/17E); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program(grant numbers:2019YJ0224); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8782141","Deformation time series;integer combination;interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR);ridge estimation","Strain;Synthetic aperture radar;Estimation;Deformable models;Time series analysis;Radar imaging","geophysical techniques;radar interferometry;synthetic aperture radar;topography (Earth)","ridge estimation;integer ambiguity detector;differential components;infrastructure deformation;accurate external DEM;SAR data stacks;pseudoobservations;DEM error mitigation;deformation time series;minimizing height effects;deformation detection;built areas;urban areas;atmospheric artifacts;wrapped phases;MTInSAR model;integer combination;near-zero baselines;pseudointerferograms;MTInSAR processing framework;DEM phase mitigation;accurate height information;multitemporal InSAR techniques;topographic residuals;differential interferograms;notable phase residues;spatial resolution;external digital elevation model;interferometric synthetic aperture radar phase;topographic component","","6","","39","IEEE","30 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Along this and with the aim of temporal decorrelation-robust focusing, a differential tomography framework based on generalized Capon estimator is investigated. The method can cope with temporal decorrelation of the distributed environment by spatiotemporal focusing with optimal bandwidth of the distributed signal. In addition, the method employs an additional parameter for coherence channel balancing in the model of generalized Capon that benefits from it in characterizing the spatiotemporal backscattering by mitigating the inconsistency between channels. The analysis is performed with a realistic simulation of temporal decorrelation in the presence of different decorrelation sources and taking into account the dependence on the vertical structure of the forested area.

The purpose of using Self-Adaptive Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization-Genetic Algorithm (SAPSOGA) is to combine two meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to search and find the feasible solution in the NP-hard change detection problem rapidly and efficiently. The hybrid algorithm is employed by letting the GA and PSO run simultaneously and similarities of GA and PSO have been considered to implement the algorithm, i.e. the population. In the SAPSOGA employed, in each iteration/generation the two population based algorithms share different amount of information or individual(s) between themselves. Thus, each algorithm informs each other about their best optimum results (fitness values and solution representations) which are obtained in their own population. The fitness function is minimized by using binary based SAPSOGA approach to produce binary change detection masks in each iteration to obtain the optimal change detection mask between two multi temporal multi spectral landsat images.

Recent studies carried out for Sentinel-1 imagery have shown that more efficient pre-filtering usually results in better classification. Thus, here we propose a modification of block matching three-dimensional (BM3D) filter adapted to the properties of Sentinel-1 radar data.

Advanced remote sensing is crucial to support cost-effective emergency response activities for disaster risk assessment and management. This preliminary study, as an effort to propose a good case study in risk management, suggested that three main steps, i.e., filtering, fusing and classifying, should be adopted to perform change detection before and after a natural disaster. We fused very high-spatial-resolution multi-temporal optical images (0.6 m spatial resolution) and X-band SAR images (2.5 m spatial resolution). The study also revealed that the decision-level method, i.e. morphological transform, was the most promising in image fusion of filtered images to classify urban surfaces in tsunami damage assessment, compared with the pixel-level method, i.e. wavelet transform, and feature-level method, i.e. segmentation extraction. This paper reports, coupled with the results from the image fusion, that the preliminary results are good enough to obtain urban impervious surface estimation of a wide disaster risk area but not good enough to make clear amplitude images to identify individual buildings of dwelling zone. The proposed normalized change index (NCI), an important indicator for detecting changes, was found capable of providing better estimation of urban impervious surfaces, such as transport-related land (e.g., bridges and parking lots) and building roof tops in residential and industrial areas over a coastal zone in Rikuzen-takada City, devastated in the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake.","","978-1-4673-7676-1","10.1109/AERO.2016.7500520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500520","","Risk management;Tsunami;Synthetic aperture radar;Earthquakes;Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Optical surface waves","disasters;earthquakes;geophysical image processing;image classification;image filtering;image fusion;image resolution;remote sensing by radar;risk management;synthetic aperture radar;tsunami","image fusion;optical data;SAR data;supervised change detection;damaged urban surface conditions;tsunami event;disaster risk reduction policies;disaster risk reduction strategies;remote sensing;cost-effective emergency response activities;disaster risk assessment;disaster risk management;natural disaster;high-spatial-resolution multitemporal optical images;spatial resolution;X-band SAR images;decision- level method;morphological transform;filtered images;urban surfaces;tsunami damage assessment;pixel-level method;wavelet transform;feature-level method;segmentation extraction;urban impervious surface estimation;disaster risk area;amplitude images;individual building dwelling zone;normalized change index;urban impervious surfaces;transport-related land;building roof;residential area;industrial area;coastal zone;Rikuzen-takada City;Great East Japan Earthquake;AD 2011","","3","","35","IEEE","30 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to control area specific weed control on basis of classification and management of disease in farmland, hyperspectral images have been acquired from the satellite images in the remote sensing area. With different observation conditions and sensor characteristics, hyperspectral image classification based on spectral evolution simultaneously extracts the sets of spectral signatures of endmembers and maps the corresponding abundance maps from multiple spectral images. It then utilizes multiple supervised and unsupervised mechanisms for class-specific variations on weed and its diseases. Obviously mapping method degrades on accuracy of the coupling of the spectral evolution simultaneously. In this paper, a novel efficient weed classification and disease management on spectral evolution mapping should be proposed using Multivariate principle component analysis. It is examined as change detection mechanism which explores variation in the class features efficiently as the context of images is basis of bands of weed plant and its associated plant diseases, further it leads to a good tradeoff between wider receptive field and the use of Context is employed towards mapping Agriculture Land cover spectral evolution in the hyperspectral images. Proposed approach is capable of computing the spectral correlation among two images with respect to spectral similarity. Finally, it predicts the large intra class variation of weed accurately on temporal changes of the agriculture surfaces along various climate seasons and fields. Experimental analysis of the proposed mechanism was validated on Landsat 8 dataset to compute overall accuracy of the model on the changes in the weed and its diseases.

Though there are many classical and deep learning (DL) based algorithms to detect changes, the performance of classical algorithms is not up to the satisfactory level and the final performance of DL models depend on efficiency of pre-detection techniques which provide prior knowledge on changed and unchanged areas that are required to get appropriate training samples to learn to detect changes. Classical and DL approaches consider change information at pixel level i.e. pixel to pixel change either by comparing the corresponding pixels alone or with their local neighborhood pixels. Therefore, identification of features for every pixel that relate the most significant information of the whole HSI-CD data in a simple and an efficient way to detect changes effectively is the need of the hour. In addition, there is not much comprehensive study on developing CD algorithms that not only simple to use but also as efficient as that of DL models is available. Therefore, in this paper, an endmember based feature extraction is proposed to detect changes in HSI. An automatic target generation process (ATGP) algorithm is adapted to extract endmembers present in the HSI-CD data set. Then, various spectral matching algorithms are used to measure endmember relations for all the pixels so that dimensionality of the data is reduced as well as the effective features to detect changes can be extracted. The experimental results on three benchmark HSI-CD data sets show that proposed ATGP based change vector analysis (CVA) algorithm yields remarkable results on comparing both with the classical as well as DL based CD approaches.","2577-1647","978-1-6654-8025-3","10.1109/IECON49645.2022.9969049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9969049","Change detection;ATGP;endmember extraction;spectral matching algorithms;HSI","Training;Industrial electronics;Change detection algorithms;Benchmark testing;Feature extraction;Data mining;Task analysis","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;geophysical signal processing;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;remote sensing","ATGP based change detection;ATGP based change vector analysis algorithm yields remarkable results;benchmark HSI-CD data sets;CD algorithms;change information;changed areas;detect changes;DL based CD approaches;ground-truth change maps;hyperspectral images;pixel change;pre-detection techniques;remote sensing applications including change detection;unchanged areas","","","","23","IEEE","9 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method is applied to a multi-temporal/multi-sensor data set used to classify wetland types.

The continuation of the deformation monitoring after the unrest event was deemed necessary, in order to validate the post-unrest state of the volcano and to recognize potential ground deformation signals. The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission is profoundly promising towards this direction, due to its systematic acquisition and short revisit. A multi-temporal SAR interferometric analysis was deliberated in a way to avoid significant phase changes and to retain high coherence. In this paper, DInSAR analysis was applied over Santorini to retrieve the actual deformation state of the volcano during the repose period 2014-2017.

These correlations severely impact speckle reduction methods that require uncorrelated speckle as input. Thus, spatial down-sampling is typically applied to reduce the speckle spatial correlations prior to speckle filtering.

Accurate maps of grazing lawn distribution is essential to enhance understanding of important ecosystem processes such as mega-herbivore population dynamics, nutrient cycling and plant community composition. The inherent heterogeneity of savannah landscapes however creates significant challenges for accurate discrimination of vegetation components and thus grazing lawn detection. Recent studies favour very high spatial resolution (VHR) multi-spectral imagery for dealing with this challenge. However, such data are costly for use in operational management. Planet Labs, through Norway's International Climate and Forests Initiative (NICFI), now grant free access to high-resolution, analysis-ready mosaics over the tropics, with great potential for fine-scale vegetation mapping. However, the spectral characteristics of these data are limited and fail to resolve the spectral similarity of different savannah vegetation components. We address these issues using Gram-Schmidt transformation to fuse Planet Basemaps and Sentinel-2A images for grazing lawn detection within the Lower Sabie region of Kruger National Park, South Africa. The original and fused images were classified using a random forest approach.

The image time series, as results of the satellite revisiting period, gives you insights not only on a certain area, but also on its representation at different moments of time. In order to limit the issues that might arise due to irregular time sampling of multispectral data, the authors propose a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image time series for analysis. To this point, the main goal is to mine the satellite image time series (SITS) for understanding the temporal behaviour of an area in terms of evolution and persistency. The paper introduces an analytical approach, combining coherent and no coherent analysis of SAR SITS content. We propose the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to extract categories of evolution from the SAR SITS and techniques which study statistical and coherent proprieties of the targets to identify the structures with stable electromagnetic characteristics over time, named Persistent Scatterers (PS). The obtained results indicate an evolutionary character hidden inside the persistent class.

Two roughness classes are identified through radar signal inversion (smooth and ploughed soils). For the retrieval of surface soil moisture at a high spatial resolution, an algorithm combing TerraSAR-X images with continuous thetaprobe measurements was proposed. Two assumptions were studied: (1) roughness variations during the radar acquisition campaigns were not accounted for; (2) a simple correction for temporal variations in roughness was included.

Among others, the small-scaled change detection method is a topic of high interest in military applications for establishing future national security systems. SAR images are distinguished from optical images due to the complex nature of the inherent phase information in conjunction with amplitude parameters. The performance of detection of changes through SAR imaging are highly dependent upon both ACD(Amplitude Change Detection) and CCD(Coherence Change Detection). The ACD method, based on measurement of amplitude, is the most common approach. It simplifies the technical mechanism of imaging as it is sensitive to changes caused by artificial objects and buildings on land. The CCD method, using the information on phase, measures the extent of similarities of multi-temporal images or their coherences. In this paper, CCD algorithms are adopted to detect local changes in dense urban areas acquired from spaceborne SAR payloads.

Rigorous inspection programs and the monitoring of these infrastructures, such as reservoir dams, are essential for the safety of citizens and properties. These interventions are usually costly and time-consuming, making in many cases, virtually impossible to monitor individually each dam which may represent a potential security risk. Multi-temporal InSAR has been successfully applied in the monitoring of infrastructures affected by tunneling works, aquifer extraction, and natural phenomena (tectonics, volcanism, seism, …), among others. The great advantage of MT-InSAR is that it provides measurement uncertainties of the order of 1 mm/year, interpreting time series of interferometric phases of coherent reflectors present in the area, called Persistent Scatterers, without the need for field work or any special equipment. To demonstrate the potential and reliability of this technique, in this paper, we present the adaptation and application of MT-InSAR technique to monitor embankment dams, obtaining vertical displacements, characterizing their consolidation rates, and allowing the identification of potential problems that require further field investigation.

However, the phase decorrelation phenomena along with other bottlenecks, such as atmospheric nuisance, orbital, and DEM inaccuracy limit the accuracy of the traditional DInSAR technique. Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR), based on DInSAR, circumvents these limitations using temporally stable reflectors or permanent scatterers (PS) of earth surface using a long temporal stack of SAR images. In this paper, a spatial correlation based PSInSAR technique is applied to detect the ground deformation of Las Vegas, Nevada, US between 2002 to 2010. This aim of this study is focused on the precise estimation and validation of ground deformation using the PSInSAR analysis of descending pass Envisat ASAR data, and further cross-validation of displacement time-series is carried out with GPS time-series observations. Archived C-band Envisat ASAR SAR data stack was used to estimate ground deformation map of the concerned area. A good correlation is observed between PSInSAR and GPS time-series.

However, the polarization scattering decomposition for multi-temporal PolSAR data easily causes “dimension disaster”. Hence, a neural network of sparse auto-encoder with non-negativity constraints (NC-SAE) was employed to compress the data, yielding efficient features for accurate classification. Then, a novel classifier of multi-scale feature classification network (MSFCN) was constructed to improve the classification performance, which is proved to be superior to the popular classifiers of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and supper vector machine (SVM). The performances of the proposed method were evaluated and compared with the traditional methods by using simulated Sentinel-1 data provided by European Space Agency (ESA).

A decision level fusion approach was developed by Gokaraju et. al, 2012, which combines statistical methods and machine learning techniques. Here, each data sample is integrated through separate classifiers such as empirical methods and support vector machines (SVMs) and then used a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) to fuse the decisions for a unified consensus decision.

The OCSRC method based on the spatial-spectral is adapted from the classical multiclass the sparse representation classifier (SRC) and has been proposed, combined with the Gabor filter, to extract spatial-spectral features. Therefore, in this paper, the spatial features extracted by LCP are combined with the spatial-spectral features extracted by the Gabor filter to detect the change of the observed area. The algorithm of LCP is completed by constructing a topological tree modified by extinction filtering and image reconstruction. Two sub-images of the multi-temporal multispectral HJ-1A obtained before and after the flood in Heilongjiang in 2013 are selected to discuss the effect of the spatial features obtained by Gabor filter with and without the combination of the LCP and the original spectral information on the performance of the OCSRC. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the accuracy of the two types of problems in change detection. The results showed that with the increasing training samples, the OCSRC combined with the LCP algorithm had better robustness at higher accuracy.

Advanced deep learning techniques represented by deep convolutional neural network (CNN) have been utilized to enhance the application performance. One current challenge is how to adapt deep CNN model for PolSAR target detection and classification with limited training samples while keeping good generalization performance. This work attempts to contribute to this problem. The core idea is to incorporate expert knowledge of target scattering mechanism interpretation and polarimetric feature mining to assist deep CNN model training and improve the final application performance. A polarimetric-feature-driven deep CNN detection and classification scheme is established. Both classical polarimetric features and hidden polarimetric features in the rotation domain are used to drive the proposed deep CNN model. Comparison studies validate the efficiency and superiority of the proposal. For ship detection application, two methods respectively driven by classical polarimetric features and the selected polarimetric features show relatively good performances, with detection probabilities over 90.8% for Radarsat-2 data. Considering the overall detection and false-alarm probabilities, the proposed polarimetric-feature-driven CNN approach achieves even better performance. For land cover classification, the proposed method achieves the state of the art classification accuracy for the benchmark AIRSAR data. Meanwhile, the convergence speed from the proposed polarimetric-feature-driven CNN approach is about 2.3 times faster than the normal CNN method. For multi-temporal UAVSAR datasets, the proposed scheme achieves comparably high classification accuracy as the normal CNN method for train-used temporal data, while for train-not-used data it obtains average 4.86% higher overall accuracy than the normal CNN method.","1559-9450","978-4-8855-2316-8","10.23919/PIERS.2018.8597856","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8597856","","Training;Marine vehicles;Electromagnetics;Feature extraction;Object detection;Scattering;Benchmark testing","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;object detection;probability;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;ships;synthetic aperture radar","polarimetric SAR targets detection;deep convolutional neural network;PolSAR target detection;good generalization performance;target scattering mechanism interpretation;polarimetric feature mining;deep CNN model training;final application performance;polarimetric-feature-driven deep CNN detection;classical polarimetric features;hidden polarimetric features;ship detection application;selected polarimetric features;relatively good performances;detection probabilities;polarimetric-feature-driven CNN approach;land cover classification;normal CNN method;advanced deep learning technique;high classification accuracy","","6","","21","","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The change of wetland mangroves has become an important ecological indicator of the impact on coastal areas. Understanding the factors controlling wetland structure is vital to conservation and management. The issue of mangrove change is valued by ecologists, but it is difficult to survey the area through traditional methods. In this study, multi-temporal FORMOSAT-2 and FORMOSAT-5 satellite images with a resolution of 4 metres were used to detect mangrove cover and changes. Changes of the mangroves over the study period showed that the mangroves have a slight growth trend from 2016 to 2019, and the changes are located at the edge of channel and mangrove forest. Using NDVI, the areas of mangroves were estimated at 10.5-ha., 10.6-ha. and 10.62-ha. in 2016, 2017 and 2019, respectively. The overall Kappa coefficients are between 0.86-0.94.

Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide quick response and huge area monitoring to mitigate the further loss. Automatic and accurate mapping of urban damage levels with SAR is still challenging. Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) has the better potential to understand urban damage conditions from the viewpoint of scattering mechanism investigation. Polarimetric coherence is an important source for PolSAR data investigation. The variation of polarimetric coherence in the rotation domain along the radar line of sight contains rich hidden information which relates to target orientation diversity effect. This work focuses on the hidden signature exploration of co-polarization coherence in the rotation domain for urban damage investigation. A damage index is proposed based on the interpretation tool of co-polarization coherence pattern and an urban damage level mapping approach are established.

Multi-temporal Interferometric SAR (MT-InSAR) is able to monitor long-term and periodic deformation with high precision by time-series analysis. However, when a new image comes, it is time-consuming to reprocess the whole dataset using the traditional algorithm. Here we propose a recursive approach to deal with InSAR time series by subsequently analyzing the amplitude and the interferometric phase. Sequential change detection is developed to identify surface changes jointly with amplitude observation and initial dataset. Based on the predicted phase residual, scatterers with a phase anomaly are identified by a generalized ratio test while the parameters of other stable scatterers are updated using a static Kalman filter. The main advantage of this method is the real-time data process. Experimental results by the proposed method show that the estimated parameters by the recursive approach agree well with that by the standard approach, and InSAR technique can be used for the real-time evaluation of the deformation risk.","2474-2333","978-1-7281-2912-9","10.1109/APSAR46974.2019.9048417","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9048417","MT-InSAR;recursive process;Kalman filter;deformation monitoring","","deformation;geophysical image processing;Kalman filters;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;time series","InSAR technique;real-time evaluation;deformation risk;InSAR data;recursive amplitude;phase process;synthetic aperture radar systems;real-time deformation monitoring;multitemporal Interferometric SAR;MT-InSAR;periodic deformation;time-series analysis;recursive approach;InSAR time series;interferometric phase;sequential change detection;surface changes;amplitude observation;phase residual;real-time data process","","","","18","IEEE","30 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we apply a multi-source feature data approach to investigate the urban area of Istanbul, Turkey which is a megacity with an approximate 15 million inhabitant, and under strong both anthropogenic and natural pressures. In order to analyse and compare the spatial pattern of the urban footprint, different techniques are applied. Speckle divergence, backscatter and repeat pass interferometric coherence values are considered for the analysis. To this aim, L-band HH and HV polarized ALOS-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data were acquired from Japan Space Exploration Agency's (JAXA). Pixel based Random Forest Classification method was used for the urban mapping. During the classification, different scenarios have been applied using speckle divergence, backscatter and coherence information. Overall, user and producer accuracies were calculated from the error matrix. While comparing HH and HV polarimetry, in each scenario HH provided much higher accuracies than HV results. Speckle divergence and backscatter values yielded similar accuracies which is around 88% for urban class. However, coherence gave approximately 69% while it is classified individually. The contribution of coherence was extracted while coherence was stacked with speckle divergence, and the result was improved to 91%. The urban areas was extracted with a maximum accuracy of maximum 93% while all information was combined. The preliminary results allow us to obtain a comprehensive image of urban structure, and indicate that the results may reference address for further analysis of multi-temporal SAR data over large and complicated mega cities.","","978-1-5386-9448-0","10.1109/RAST.2019.8767819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8767819","ALOS-2;urban;coherence;polarimetry;classification","","geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;image classification;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","urban area extraction;ALOS-2 data;urbanization;dynamic structure;megacity;rapid detection;sustainable management;multisource feature data;strong both anthropogenic pressures;natural pressures;spatial pattern;urban footprint;different techniques;speckle divergence;repeat pass interferometric coherence values;Japan Space Exploration Agency;Random Forest Classification method;urban mapping;coherence information;producer accuracies;higher accuracies;HV results;backscatter values;similar accuracies;urban class;urban areas;maximum accuracy;urban structure;multitemporal SAR data","","","","15","IEEE","22 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this way of selecting sample inevitably introduces erroneous labels and imbalance between unchanged and changed classes, thus causing deterioration in change detection performance. To mitigate these issues, we have proposed a SAR change detection network based on visual saliency and multi-hierarchical fuzzy clustering. Specifically, with multi-dimensional difference feature representations, a visual saliency based difference map is constructed for accurate difference feature extraction. By integrating neighborhood information and hierarchical clustering, the multi-hierarchical fuzzy local information C-means clustering algorithm has been developed to identify potential changed regions for sample selection. A class-balanced adaptive focal loss has further been incorporated into the network training to obtain accurate predictions. Extensive experiments and comparisons on five datasets have been performed.

Another alternative is the multitemporal analysis, which detects changes from one image already classified to another, corresponding to the same surface on different dates. The common denominator applies both techniques separately in order to take advantage of the characteristics of a classified image. Therefore, the current study aims to combine multi-temporality and different indexes to integrate both characteristics and facilitate the identification of burned areas. The study area is located in southern Chile with the corresponding dates from January 15 to 30,2017, where fires consumed much of the endemic forestation of the area. The methodology applied has been based on obtaining and correcting Landsat 8 satellite images prior and after the event. Following this, the different indexes have been calculated to apply the change detection. Thereafter, the results have been integrated to make a multitemporal RGB combination of the new bands where, in the red quill corresponds to the indexes before the event, the green quill to the indexes after the event and the blue quill to the multitemporal difference. As a result of the multi-temporal index combinations, the outstanding index is the SAVI-Multitemporal, which allows 93% visual discrimination of the areas affected by the fires, unlike the SAVI, BAI, GEMI, BAI indexes -Multitemporal and GEMI-Multitemporal with a percentage of discrimination of about 73.33%, 66.67%, 80%, 20% and 86.67%, respectively.

With increasing deployments of highly capable commercial satellites offering high spectral and spatial resolution, global coverage and site revisit rates, predictive structural instability/integrity assessment is becoming accessible at a fraction of cost of aerial and ground based solutions. This paper presents an overview of the opportunities and challenges in affordably monitoring new and longstanding large buildings, monuments and ground infrastructure. This is necessitated by increasingly intense exploitation of environmental resources, hydrogeological instabilities and risk of natural disasters in environments perturbed by human activities that has created new risks.

The underlying SPINUA (Stable Point Interferometry Even Over Unurbanized Areas) technique has already been shown to be robust in non- and scarcely urbanized areas.

New results are presented that combine Quantum Resonance Interferometry (QRI) SNR and SCR enhancement processing within RD computational pipeline for extending the reliability of displacement computations to complex, vegetated ground topography and reducing the number of ground fiducials. New results are presented on dataset acquired using ESA's Sentinel-l C-band InSAR instrument (with revisit time of 6 days) with high swath-width over a site in Southern Italy.

Microdrone solutions, providing video streaming capabilities, are already available on the marketplace, but they are limited to altitudes of a few hundred feet. In contrast, UAVs equipped with high quality cameras can fly at altitudes of a few thousand feet and can fill the gap between satellite observations and ground sensors. Therefore, new needs for data processing arise, spanning from computer vision algorithms to sensor and mission management. This paper presents a solution for automatically detecting changes in images acquired at different times by patrolling UAVs flying over the same targets (but not necessarily along the same path or at the same altitude). Change detection in multi-temporal images is a prerequisite for land cover inspection, which, in turn, sets up the basis for detecting potentially dangerous or threatening situations.","","978-1-4673-8167-3","10.1109/RTSI.2015.7325122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7325122","change detection;computer vision;remote sensing;surveillance;spatiotemporal features;video signal processing;unmanned aerial vehicles","Image color analysis;Streaming media;Change detection algorithms;Image edge detection;Feature extraction;Cameras;Metadata","autonomous aerial vehicles;robot vision;video streaming","unmanned aerial vehicle images;UAV;civil aviation;environmental monitoring;public surveillance services;earth observation;satellite images;video streaming;high quality cameras;satellite observations;ground sensors;computer vision algorithms;mission management;change detection;multitemporal images","","5","","25","IEEE","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using a multi-temporal approach, two images (respectively acquired in August 2000 and in 2005) were considered. The mapping of land use was carried out following an approach of supervised classification according to the Maximum Likelihood algorithm with 17 training sites, in order to evaluate the effects of the interventions of urbanization and both extension and variation of agricultural crops. The thermal maps were realized by means of the ESN (Emissivity Spectral Normalization) method, defining the thermal gradients in the area under investigation. The spatial and temporal anomalies related to the temperature distribution were highlighted; these anomalies represent an important parameter for the identification of probable groundwater pollution and soil contamination.","","978-1-5090-3596-0","10.1109/I2MTC.2017.7969745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7969745","Remote Sensing;ASTER;Land Surface Temperature (LST);thermal monitoring;change detection;thermal map","Instrumentation and measurement","emissivity;environmental monitoring (geophysics);geophysical image processing;image classification;infrared imaging;land use;maximum likelihood estimation;surface topography measurement;temperature distribution;temperature measurement;temperature sensors","soil contamination;groundwater pollution;temperature distribution;thermal gradient;emissivity spectral normalization method;ESN method;agricultural crop;maximum likelihood algorithm;supervised classification;multitemporal approach;surface temperature determination;land use mapping;marine environment;thermal map;change detection;environmental monitoring analysis;ASTER image","","2","","21","IEEE","7 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We partition the difference image into small data blocks with non-overlapping and overlapping pixels and use these data blocks to justify the changing status of the contents. However, instead of building an eigen space from the orthonormal eigenvectors extracted through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the data blocks, we analyze the singular values and use only a small subset of the values. This eigen space with much smaller number of dimensions helped to significantly improve the efficiency of the change detection algorithm. The change detection is achieved by partitioning the feature vector space into two clusters using clustering algorithms. We utilize the designs of scalable and efficient parallel algorithms for many-core GPU devices using CUDA. Our algorithms expose substantial fine-grained parallelism while maintaining minimal global communication. Experimental results using real-world satellite images showed that our algorithm works efficiently with real world satellite images. We also tested our algorithm under different noise conditions and found that it is stable and accurate.","","978-1-7281-1360-9","10.1109/CSCI46756.2018.00083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8947879","Remote Sensing;Image processing;Principal Component Analysis;Change Detection;SVD","Satellites;Change detection algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Covariance matrices;Principal component analysis;Data mining","data mining;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;graph theory;graphics processing units;image resolution;multiprocessing systems;parallel algorithms;parallel architectures;pattern clustering;principal component analysis;shared memory systems","orthonormal eigenvectors;CUDA;overlapping pixels;difference image;satellite image processing;multitemporal satellite images;unsupervised change detection;high performance hybrid method;data mining techniques;high performance CPU-GPU algorithm;real-world satellite images;many-core GPU devices;parallel algorithms;scalable algorithms;clustering algorithms;feature vector space;change detection algorithm;singular values;data blocks;principal component analysis;eigen space","","","","11","IEEE","2 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We monitored the N status and GPC of winter wheat based on wheat leaf-level and canopy-level chlorophyll sensitivity parameters using two hand-held instruments: SPAD-502 for wheat leaves and Multiplex 3 for the canopy. The SPAD value of the first two fully expanded leaves of winter wheat and nine wheat canopy fluorescence parameters were measured at five growth stages from April to June 2012. The correlation between the SPAD value and the canopy fluorescence parameters were then analyzed and compared for their accuracy in assessing leaf N content (LNC), canopy N density (CND), and GPC. Canopy-level fluorescence parameters were more accurate for estimating CND than leaf SPAD and LNC. The results of our study also indicate that leaf-level SPAD and canopy-level fluorescence spectral parameters are all sensitive to GPC. A partial least-squares regression (PLSR) method was used to estimate GPC based on the multi-temporal leaf SPAD value and canopy fluorescence parameters. Estimating GPC using PLSR with multiple stages of fluorescence variables yielded greater estimation accuracy [R2= 0.766 and root mean square of error prediction (RMSEP) = 0.563%] than the SPAD variables [R2= 0.653 and RMSEP = 0.707%]. Thus, we conclude that canopy-level fluorescence spectral parameters are better indicators for wheat growth activity and can be used to successfully estimate winter wheat GPC.","","978-1-5386-5038-7","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2018.8476117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8476117","Winter wheat;Leaf nitrogen content (LNC);Canopy nitrogen density (CND);SPAD;Fluorescence","Fluorescence;Agriculture;Nitrogen;Multiplexing;Correlation;Proteins;Filling","crops;fluorescence;least squares approximations;proteins;regression analysis","SPAD variables;multitemporal leaf SPAD value;leaf-level SPAD;canopy-level fluorescence parameters;leaf N content;wheat canopy fluorescence parameters;wheat leaves;SPAD-502;canopy-level chlorophyll sensitivity parameters;wheat leaf-level;grain protein content estimation;crop growth diagnosis;winter wheat leaf;wheat nitrogen;winter wheat GPC;wheat growth activity;canopy-level fluorescence spectral parameters","","1","","24","IEEE","30 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The initial result is obtained according to the minimum distance of the time series curve. Then, using local time change boundary constraints, the results are optimized. The research area is the Dongting Lake Beach Wetland, and the Sentinel-1 GRD data of 2020 is collected using Google Earth Engine platform. Comprehensive evaluation of Canberra's distance and cosine angle can improve the accuracy of woodland and reeds; The boundary constraints of changes from January to February can improve the error of water bodies being divided into mudflats. The overall accuracy in this paper can reach 89.5%, which is higher than the random forest.

However, intrinsic complexity of satellite images will introduce more difficulties to change detection tasks. In this study, a new change detection method is proposed by combining multi-scale simple linear iterative clustering-convolutional neural network (SLIC-CNN) with stacked convolutional auto-encoder (SCAE) features to improve change detection capabilities with VHR satellite images. First, the multi-scale SLIC-based image segmentation is performed on multi-temporal images to generate segment objects while keeping their edge information as much as possible. Second, the convolutional layers in a CNN architecture are used to generate change map, then, an SCAE feature-based classification procedure is performed to generate “from-to” change information. Finally, a Bayesian information criterion is used to optimize the results of change detection. In this study, the experiments carried out reveal that the multi-scale SLIC image segmentation algorithm affects the integrity of change regions; CNN features have an effect on the consistency of change regions; and SCAE features influence the performance of support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. And, features extracted from the architectures enhance the ability of information extraction from ground objects. Comparison results also show the superiority to other change detection methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3045740","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFC0505903); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9298743","Change detection;image segmentation;multi-scale simple linear iterative clustering-convolutional neural network (SLIC-CNN);stacked convolutional auto-encoder (SCAE);VHR satellite imagery","Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Satellites;Change detection algorithms;Spatial resolution;Computer architecture;Detection algorithms","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image segmentation;support vector machines","stacked convolutional auto-encoder;VHR satellite images;multiscale SLIC-based image segmentation;multitemporal images;CNN architecture;change map;CNN features;SCAE features;land cover change detection;VHR satellite imagery;multiscale SLIC-CNN;high resolution satellite images;land use changes;multiscale simple linear iterative clustering-convolutional neural network;multiscale SLIC image segmentation;SCAE feature-based classification","","5","","50","CCBYNCND","18 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
