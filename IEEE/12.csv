In this study, we provide results update on RCM performance for selected SAR applications. The RCM was designed to address three core applications-disaster management, maritime surveillance, and ecosystem monitoring. Our study shows a promising level of agreement between RCM and RADARSAT-2 performance in flood mapping using dual-polarized HH-HV SAR data over Red River, Manitoba. Visual analysis of coincident RCM compact polarimetric and RADARSAT-2 dual-polarized HH-HV SAR imagery over the Resolute Passage, Canadian Central Arctic, highlighted an improved contrast between sea ice classes in dry ice winter conditions. Object-oriented classification of a wetland area in Newfoundland and Labrador by fusion of RCM dual-polarized VV-VH data and Sentinel-2 optical imagery revealed promising classification results, with an overall accuracy of 91.1% and a kappa coefficient of 0.87.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-2792-0","10.1109/IGARSS46834.2022.9883906","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9883906","RCM;Compact Polarimetry;flood mapping;sea ice analysis;wetland classification","Performance evaluation;Visualization;Surveillance;Radar imaging;Radar polarimetry;Rivers;Synthetic aperture radar","floods;geophysical image processing;image classification;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission;core applications-disaster management;RADARSAT-2 performance;dual-polarized HH-HV SAR data;Canadian Central Arctic;RCM dual-polarized VV-VH data;Sentinel-2 optical imagery;object-oriented classification;Red river;Manitoba;Resolute Passage;dry ice winter conditions;sea ice classes","","","","10","IEEE","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this letter, we present an algorithm for lead detection based on brightness temperature observations from a single thermal infrared (TIR) channel of Moderate Resolution Spectral Imager Type II (MERSI-II) onboard the Chinese FY-3D satellite. Lead contents are classified into OW and TI with support information from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Results are evaluated based on the visual interpretation of MERSI-II TIR and Sentinel-2 near infrared (NIR) data. The accuracy is found to be 85.6% for lead detection and 67% and 52% for TI and OW within the lead, respectively.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2022.3223689","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41976214); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFC1509104); Innovation Group Project of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai)(grant numbers:311021008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9958942","Arctic;FY-3D Moderate Resolution Spectral Imager Type II (MERSI-II);lead;Sentinel-1;thermal infrared (TIR) data","Lead;Ice;MODIS;Ocean temperature;Arctic;Synthetic aperture radar;Satellites","geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;oceanographic regions;radar imaging;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","Arctic ice cover;Arctic Using FY-3D;brightness temperature observations;Chinese FY-3D satellite;infrared data;lead contents;MERSI-II;Moderate Resolution Spectral Imager Type II;open water;OW;possible contents;Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data;single thermal infrared channel;winter sea-ice lead detection","","","","19","IEEE","23 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
