"Spatio-Temporal Urban Growth Pattern in the Arctic: A Case Study in Surgut, Russia","C. Ourng; Y. Vaguet; A.

This paper presents the urban land use change over time of an Arctic pioneer town, Surgut (Russia). This town unfolds during the soviet era, embedded with oil production, and grew up to become the country oil capital. Surgut is nowadays one of the healthier Russian Arctic towns and has always been attractive even during the severe decrease in population of the Russian Arctic zone over the decade of the USSR collapse. Various multi-temporal satellite imageries (1973-2018) were used to generate the map and analyze the urban expansion, land transformation, and growth directions in order to understand the nature of built-up growth in a soviet Arctic city and its post-soviet evolution.","2642-9535","978-1-7281-0009-8","10.1109/JURSE.2019.8809013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8809013","Arctic;soviet;town;growth;time-series","Radar imaging;Spaceborne radar;Arctic;Urban areas;Sociology;Statistics","geographic information systems;geophysical image processing;land cover;land use;remote sensing;town and country planning","spatio-temporal urban growth pattern;Surgut;spatial-temporal analysis;land cover pattern;urban land use change;Arctic pioneer town;soviet era;oil production;healthier Russian Arctic towns;Russian Arctic zone;multitemporal satellite imageries;urban expansion;land transformation;soviet Arctic city","","1","","12","IEEE","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For instance, they could be used in order to evaluate and assess civil infrastructures at scale, which is costly due to the fact that typically the existing methods rely on in-situ evaluation. Over the last decade Deep Learning technologies have risen as the state of the art methods for many different machine learning problems due to the fact that they can learn complex features and model complex non-linear behaviours. In this paper we will explore the possibility of using Deep Learning technologies over remote sensing data with the aim of structure health monitoring at scale. We will compare the performance of new Deep Learning technologies with regards to other traditional machine learning methods. For this purpose, we will use InSAR (Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar) data which allow us to measure cumulative surface displacement in the line of sight of the sensor with millimetric accuracy. We will analyse multi temporal InSAR data in order to model ground subsidence. In this paper we will discuss how deep learning technologies can learn to detect terrain subsidence over multi-temporal InSAR data automatically, providing much better results than traditional methods.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554639","Centre for Integrated Remote Sensing and Forecasting for Arctic Operations (CIRFA) and the Research Council of Norway(grant numbers:237906); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9554639","Remote sensing;InSAR;Deep Learning;clustering","Deep learning;Machine learning algorithms;Urban areas;Time series analysis;Clustering algorithms;Task analysis;Sustainable development","condition monitoring;learning (artificial intelligence);radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","urban areas;machine learning techniques;in-situ evaluation;different machine learning problems;deep learning technologies;remote sensing data;structure health monitoring;traditional machine learning methods;multitemporal InSAR data;structural health monitoring","","","","14","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firn identification was achieved through the multi-temporal SAR approach. The performance of the mass balance retrieval algorithm was validated with the ground-based measured mass balance over the Austre Grønfjordbreen, Svalbard. Using elevation rate of change and density (900 ±10 kg/m3) for ice and firn (600 ±200 kg/m3) areas, mass balance is estimated. The mean of geodetic mass balance is found to be -1.47 ± 0.01 m w. e. a-1 with constant density and -1.40 ± 0.06 m w. e. a-1 with the consideration of adaptive density for ice and firn area and then compared with field data (-1.38 m w. e. a-1). The mean mass balance of the proposed method is near to the field based calculated mass balance.","","978-1-6654-4249-7","10.1109/InGARSS51564.2021.9792005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9792005","Firn density;glacier facies;SAR;Mass Balance;Svalbard","Geoscience and remote sensing;Estimation;Ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Monitoring","geodesy;glaciology;ice;synthetic aperture radar","Austre Grønfjordbreen;glacier mass balance;Svalbard;adaptive mass balance inversion algorithm;ice;mass balance retrieval algorithm;geodetic mass balance;firn area;mean mass balance;size -1.48 m to -1.46 m;size -1.46 m to -1.3399999999999999 m;size -1.38 m","","","","5","IEEE","13 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
