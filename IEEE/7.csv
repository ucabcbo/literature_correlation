High-resolution monitoring of polar sea ice relies mainly on optical satellite imagery and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, with limited spatial and temporal coverages for many applications. Passive microwave data is an important data source for continuous observations of polar sea ice, thanks to its working ability in all-sky conditions and its wide coverage. However, it is difficult to achieve high-resolution monitoring of polar sea ice using passive microwave data due to its coarse resolution. In order to solve this problem, super resolution (SR) reconstruction technique is adopted in this paper to improve the spatial resolution of passive microwave images. SR reconstruction technique based on both single-image and multi-image are attempted. AMSR2 level 3 (L3) Products of Brightness Temperatures (BTs) for Arctic sea ice are used as experimental data, and the reconstruction results obtained from different SR methods are compared and discussed.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8898488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8898488","Super Resolution;passive microwave;Arctic;sea ice","Sea ice;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave imaging;Microwave integrated circuits;Microwave theory and techniques;Arctic;Microwave radiometry;Climate change","oceanographic techniques;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","super resolution reconstruction technique;passive microwave images;Arctic sea ice;polar sea ice;polar environmental change;high-resolution monitoring;synthetic aperture radar data;passive microwave data;data source;global climate change;optical satellite imagery;all-sky conditions;coarse resolution;spatial resolution;AMSR2 level 3 products;brightness temperatures","","","","14","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Continuous monitoring of Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) primarily relies on passive microwave images. However, passive microwave images have coarse spatial resolution, resulting in SIC production with significant blurring at the ice–water divides. In this article, a novel multi-image super-resolution (MISR) network called progressive multiscale deformable residual network (PMDRnet) is proposed to improve the spatial resolution of sea ice passive microwave images according to the characteristics of both passive microwave images and sea ice motions. To achieve image alignment with complex and large Arctic sea ice motions, we design a novel alignment module that includes a progressive alignment strategy and a multiscale deformable convolution alignment unit. In addition, the temporal attention mechanism is used to adaptively fuse the effective spatiotemporal information across image sequence. The sea ice-related loss function is designed to provide more detailed sea ice information of the network to improve super-resolution performance and further benefit finer Arctic SIC results. Experimental results demonstrate that PMDRnet significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art MISR methods and can generate super-resolved SIC products with finer texture features and much sharper sea ice edges.

However, its coarse spatial resolution leads to blurring effects at the ice-water divides, resulting in the great challenges of fine-scale and accurate SIC estimation, especially for regions with low SIC. Besides, the SIC derived by operational algorithms using high-frequency passive microwave observations has great uncertainties in open water or marginal ice zones due to atmospheric effects. In this article, a novel framework is proposed to achieve accurately SIC estimation with improved spatial details from original low-resolution Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) images, with joint the super-resolution (SR) and SIC estimation network. Based on the SR network, the spatial resolution of original AMSR2 images can be improved by four times, benefiting to construct AMSR2 SR features with more high-frequency information for SIC estimation. The SIC network with an encoder–decoder structure and atrous convolution, is employed to accurately perform the SIC retrieval by considering the characteristics of passive microwave images in the Arctic sea ice region. Experimental results show that the proposed SR-Aided SIC estimation approach can generate accurate SIC with more detailed sea ice textures and much sharper sea ice edges. With respect to MODIS SIC products distributed in Arctic scale, the proposed model achieves a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 5.94% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.04%, whereas the Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study (ARTIST) Sea Ice (ASI) SIC results have three and two times greater values of RMSE and MAE.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3232533","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0603100,2021YFB3900105); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41801335,41941006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9999481","Arctic sea ice concentration;convolutional neural networks;passive microwave image;super resolution","Spatial resolution;Estimation;Sea ice;Microwave integrated circuits;Microwave imaging;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave theory and techniques","edge detection;geophysical image processing;image resolution;mean square error methods;microwave imaging;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radiometry;remote sensing;sea ice","AMSR2 SR features;Arctic scale;Arctic sea ice region;Arctic-wide sea ice concentration;atrous convolution;blurring effects;coarse spatial resolution;encoder-decoder networks;encoder-decoder structure;high-frequency information;high-frequency passive microwave observations;ice-water divides;low-resolution Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 images;MODIS SIC products;open water;original AMSR2 images;passive microwave data;passive microwave images;sea ice edges;sea ice textures;SIC network;SIC retrieval;spatial details;SR network;SR-Aided SIC estimation approach;super-resolution-Aided Sea Ice concentration estimation;Turbulence Interaction Study Sea Ice SIC results","","","","30","CCBYNCND","27 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the longer revisit time of homologous spaceborne satellites, only an average velocity can be determined. For longer time intervals, velocities due to short-duration events such as storms are lost. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from different sources make it easy to construct image sequences with short time intervals. However, the resolution and noise level between non-homologous SAR image pairs often differ greatly. When there is a relatively large resolution difference between image pairs, the areal features between image pairs are very different, which increases the difficulty of feature registration. In this paper, a super-resolution reconstruction method is proposed to solve the problem of resolution difference between image pairs for sea ice drift. This method can significantly improve the quality of feature registration of image pairs from different SAR sensors. We demonstrate through several examples the effectiveness of the method in feature matching of large resolution difference images from different SAR sensors.","","978-1-6654-0413-6","10.1109/ICSP51882.2021.9408919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9408919","Feature matching;Image registration;Sea ice drift tracking;Super-resolution reconstruction;Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)","Image sensors;Storms;Spaceborne radar;Superresolution;Radar tracking;Radar polarimetry;Synthetic aperture radar","image reconstruction;image registration;image resolution;image sequences;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","resolution difference images;different SAR sensors;feature registration;resolution difference nonhomologous SAR image pairs;sea ice drift tracking;SAR images;longer revisit time;homologous spaceborne satellites;longer time intervals;Synthetic Aperture Radar images;image sequences;short time intervals;noise level;super-resolution reconstruction method","","1","","12","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accurately tracking sea ice motions is essential to validate or even improve sea ice models for ice hazard forecasts at a fine scale. Fine-scale motions can be tracked from high-resolution radar or optical satellite imagery but with limited coverage. Daily motions over the entire Arctic are retrievable from passive microwave data, but at a much lower spatial resolution. Thus, providing motions at the passive microwave spatial and temporal coverage, but at an enhanced spatial resolution, will be a significant benefit. To break the resolution limitation and to boost tracking accuracy, a sequential super-resolved fine-scale sea ice motion tracking framework is proposed in which a hybrid example-based single image super-resolution algorithm is employed before the tracking procedure. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the tracking performance in both accuracy and robustness for a benchmark algorithm and a recently proposed state-of-the-art tracking algorithm.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2699081","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N000141310450); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8006299","AMSR2;example-based learning;maximum cross correlation (MCC);motion tracking;passive microwave;patch redundancy;sea ice;Suomi national polar-orbiting partnership (NPP);super-resolution (SR)","Sea ice;Tracking;Spatial resolution;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave imaging;Microwave integrated circuits","geophysical image processing;hazards;image resolution;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing by radar;sea ice","super-resolved sea ice motion tracking;fine-scale sea ice motion;sea ice activity monitoring;Arctic Ocean;ice hazard forecasts;high-resolution radar;optical satellite imagery;passive microwave data;tracking accuracy;single image super-resolution algorithm","","12","","50","IEEE","9 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
