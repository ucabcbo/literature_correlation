Wavelet transform is used to break the complex images into small units and can be reconstructed with high precision. The EZW algorithm is a lossy compression algorithm and it achieves better compression ratio at low bit rates. The principle of Huffman coding is the data that occurs frequently are reduced or encoded in to number of bits. Experiments are carried with the multi-spectral IKONOS satellite imagery and Still image (LENA). The results showed that there is an increase in compression ratio. Moreover, the accuracy of the reconstructed image is calculated using confusion matrices. The overall users accuracy and producers accuracy of the reconstructed IKONOS image is 96.02% and 95.51% respectively.","","978-1-5090-5240-0","10.1109/ICCICCT.2016.7988040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7988040","Discrete Wavelet Transform;Huffman coding;Multi-spectral images;Compression","Image coding;Discrete wavelet transforms;Image reconstruction;Satellites;Huffman coding","discrete wavelet transforms;image coding;image reconstruction;trees (mathematics)","multispectral satellite image compression;EZW algorithm;discrete wavelet transform;embedded zero tree wavelet algorithm;Huffman coding techniques;confusion matrices;IKONOS image reconstruction","","4","","11","IEEE","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, machine learning models have been applied for crop classification of Sentinel-2 satellite temporal remote sensing image data. Guntur district region of Andhra Pradesh, India has been used as the study area. The main reasons for selecting this region are the diversity of agricultural crops and the availability of ground truth. The performance of machine learning models Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and RNN with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) have been evaluated for crop classification. Classification accuracies are generally evaluated by using test data. In most cases the classification accuracy from test data is not commensurate to estimated crop areas from the classified image. Such methods limit the estimated crop areas acceptance for official purposes. The uniqueness of this work is the classification accuracy is evaluated by estimated crop areas. The results show that SVM has the best F1 score of 0.99 and estimated major crop areas have 95.9% agreement with the ground surveyed crop area.","","978-1-7281-5453-4","10.1109/IMCOM48794.2020.9001718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9001718","Artificial Intelligence;classification;crop-wise area statistics;remote sensing;and multi-spectral satellite image","Agriculture;Machine learning;Remote sensing;Satellites;Vegetation mapping;Support vector machines;Training data","convolutional neural nets;crops;geophysical image processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;statistical analysis;support vector machines;vegetation mapping","national economy;critical decisions;agricultural statistics;Sentinel-2 satellite temporal remote sensing image data;agricultural crops;machine learning models;recurrent neural network;long short-term memory;gated recurrent unit;ground surveyed crop area;temporal multispectral satellite image;artificial intelligence;efficient AI models;high-power computational resources;support vector machine;satellite remote sensing image data processing;Guntur district region;convolution neural network;Indian crop classification;SVM","","3","","33","IEEE","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The comparison experiment found that compared with the original image, the fused image has greatly improved the ability to recognize the topography of rivers, lakes, land and sea boundaries, and mountain range trends.

Two sets of experiments are conducted using the model by feeding it with different features. First level of experiment is done by providing the model with Near-Infrared (NIR) band information as it can sense vegetation health.

Although being powerful, deep generative model in its common form with a single discriminator could be unstable for achieving spatial consistency on local textured regions, especially highly textured ones. To address this issue, the generator in our proposed structure produces a group of colored outputs from feature maps at different scale levels of the network, each being supervised by an independent discriminator to fit the original colored training input in discrete Lab color space. The final colored output is a cascaded ensemble of these preceding by-products via summation, thus the fitting errors are reduced by a geometric series form.

We firstly used inherent features of a segmented object to determine whether this object should be segmented with a smaller scale in a top-down segmentation procedure, producing a segmentation map with optimal scales. Then, an object-based SVM classifier was applied on the adaptive-scale segmentation map to yield a land-cover map. We have applied this method on a ZY-3 multi-spectral satellite image to produce land cover map, compared with the results using the traditional mean shift algorithm with fixed scales. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method is practically helpful and efficient to improve the performance of land cover mapping.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-4951-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8126894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8126894","OBIA;LUCC;ZY-3 satellite image;scale selection;multi-scale segmentation","Image segmentation;Complexity theory;Feature extraction;Satellites;Shape;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution","geophysical image processing;image classification;image segmentation;image sensors;land cover;remote sensing;support vector machines;terrain mapping","object-based land cover mapping;adaptive scale segmentation;ZY-3 satellite images;satellite imaging sensors;object-based image analysis;scale selection;multiscale segmentation;inherent features;segmented object;segmentation procedure;smaller scale;optimal scales;adaptive-scale segmentation map;land-cover map;multispectral satellite image;land cover map;fixed scales","","2","","18","IEEE","4 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Land cover classification is an important application of satellite imagery. The results obtained from land cover classification is used to observe land use and changes such as resource planning, to detect deforestation, desertification and water scarcity. Land cover classification also helps in identifying the changes in the land cover. Most satellites along with high-end sensors provides pixel wise data. Due to high resolution images, the number of pixels which are generated are in millions even for the study of a small area. Therefore there is a need to balance runtime and accuracy for this task.

These applications require the manual identification of objects and facilities in the imagery. Because the geographic expanses to be covered are great and the analysts available to conduct the searches are few, automation is required. Yet traditional object detection and classification algorithms are too inaccurate and unreliable to solve the problem. Deep learning is a family of machine learning algorithms that have shown promise for the automation of such tasks. It has achieved success in image understanding by means of convolutional neural networks. In this paper we apply them to the problem of object and facility recognition in high-resolution, multi-spectral satellite imagery. We describe a deep learning system for classifying objects and facilities from the IARPA Functional Map of the World (fMoW) dataset into 63 different classes. The system consists of an ensemble of convolutional neural networks and additional neural networks that integrate satellite metadata with image features. It is implemented in Python using the Keras and TensorFlow deep learning libraries and runs on a Linux server with an NVIDIA Titan X graphics card. At the time of writing the system is in 2nd place in the fMoW TopCoder competition.

We propose an encoder-decoder neural network based on the Efficient Residual Factorized Convnet(ERFNet), for multi-class segmentation of urban floods from multi-spectral satellite imagery. The ERFNet architecture capitalizes on skip connections and one dimensional convolutions to achieve the best possible trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

Reflectance values of cirrus band are used for correcting red and near infra-red spectral channels based on standard cirrus correction algorithm. The NDVI values obtained after cirrus correction is found to be significantly more than that of NDVI values without cirrus correction. In the case of AFRI(2.1m), the difference in values between before and after cirrus correction is found to be considerably lower than that of NDVI variation.

This map can be used as a baseline map to allow efficient monitoring. In this work, we aim to establish a framework for short term updates to the maps to quickly enable efficient planning. With the availability of multi-spectral images, various spectral bands apart from visible (Red, Green and Blue) bands can be used in habitat mapping. This paper presents the work of land cover classification in the region of Abu Dhabi, UAE using a Worldview-2 satellite image. The proposed approach makes use of Random Forest algorithm, applied on the Fully-Connected features obtained from AlexNet framework using a 20% training samples on a 3-band input. Then, ensemble of outputs of Random Forest over different 3-bands combination is used to make the final prediction. The results are validated against the ground truth obtained from Environment Agency, Abu Dhabi. Eventually, our aim is to develop a robust classification approach and then adapt automatic change detection approaches to temporally update the baseline maps.","","978-1-7281-0257-3","10.1109/CSPIS.2018.8642722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8642722","","Remote sensing;Satellites;Monitoring;Image resolution;Deep learning;Signal processing;Information security","geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;land use;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing;terrain mapping","multispectral images;habitat mapping;land cover classification;Worldview-2 satellite image;Random Forest algorithm;AlexNet framework;ensemble approach;extensive habitat;very high resolution satellite imagery;Environment Agency-Abu Dhabi;AD 2015;land use maps;AD 2011;AD 2013;UAE","","2","","12","IEEE","17 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The probable reasons for not having accurate and transparent statistics on Indian agronomy would be the existing inadequate facilities, unstable mechanism, and sluggish government functionaries. With the advent of remote sensing technologies, researchers are optimistic towards addressing such problems. It would be great challenge to classify multi-spectral satellite images due to its complexity, processing skills, and classification. The reviews on problems and prospects of supervised and unsupervised classification techniques, is highlighted in this paper. Literatures stated that one of such statistical learning model is support vector machine algorithm, which reveals to be the best suitable algorithm for vegetation discrimination using remote sensing images. In this paper, an attempt is made in order to enhance the performance of SVM by optimizing its training part. The approach aims at investigating improvement corners on SVM classification for estimating agricultural area using remote sensing data and explores futuristic research in this domain too. Several attempts have been made using supervised SVM model, but use of EA for enhancement of SVM is the novelty that distinguishes this research weigh against the traditional approaches. Findings of such intermingling is put forth through this approach in constructive way so as to address crop identification for reducing the manual efforts taken to measure the agricultural area covered by the specific crops.","","978-1-4799-8047-5","10.1109/IADCC.2015.7154771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154771","support vector machine;SVM;evolutionay algorithm;GA;kappa;EA;optimization;SMO;OSH;GIS","Training;Support vector machines;Accuracy;Remote sensing;Agriculture;Satellites;Classification algorithms","crops;geophysical image processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;remote sensing;statistical analysis;support vector machines","optimization;statistical learning algorithm;crop discrimination;Indian economy;agricultural production;sown area;Indian agronomy;remote sensing technologies;multispectral satellite image classification;unsupervised classification techniques;statistical learning model;support vector machine algorithm;vegetation discrimination;remote sensing images;SVM classification;agricultural area estimation;remote sensing data","","3","","18","IEEE","13 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These methods focused on various types of convolutional neural network (CNN) structures, which were trained by simply minimizing a spectral loss between network outputs and the corresponding high-resolution (HR) multi-spectral (MS) target images. However, owing to different sensor characteristics and acquisition times, HR panchromatic (PAN) and low-resolution MS image pairs tend to have large pixel misalignments, especially for moving objects in the images. Conventional CNNs trained with only the spectral loss with these satellite image data sets often produce PS images of low visual quality including double-edge artifacts along strong edges and ghosting artifacts on moving objects. In this letter, we propose a novel loss function, called a spectral-spatial structure (S3) loss, based on the correlation maps between MS targets and PAN inputs. Our proposed S3 loss can be very effectively used for pan-sharpening with various types of CNN structures, resulting in significant visual improvements on PS images with suppressed artifacts.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2019.2934493","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning through the Basic Science Research Program(grant numbers:2017R1A2A2A05001476); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812763","Convolutional neural network (CNN);deep learning;pan colorization;pan-sharpening;satellite imagery;spectral-spatial structure;super-resolution (SR)","Training;Satellites;Correlation;Spatial resolution;Visualization;Convolutional neural networks","convolutional neural nets;geophysical image processing;image classification;image fusion;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing","spectral-spatial structure loss;MS targets;PAN inputs;CNN structures;PS images;deep-learning-based pan-sharpening methods;high-quality pan-sharpened satellite images;convolutional neural network structures;spectral loss;network outputs;multispectral target images;HR panchromatic;moving objects;satellite image data sets;double-edge artifacts;strong edges;ghosting artifacts;loss function","","11","","32","IEEE","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, ST is used in each high-spatial-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image and multi-spectral image (MS). Then, the low frequency sub-band coefficients from different images are combined according to the HFD method which estimates and selects the modified low-pass band automatically. The composition of different high-pass sub-band coefficients achieved by the ST decomposition is discussed in detail. Finally, we achieve fusion results from the inverse transformation of ST. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms many state-of-the-art techniques in both subjective and objective evaluation measures.","","978-1-4799-8792-4","10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275939","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275939","Remote sensing image fusion;Shearlet Transform;Hausdorff fractal dimension;mutual information","Image fusion;Remote sensing;Fractals;Image edge detection;Satellites;Discrete wavelet transforms","image colour analysis;image enhancement;image fusion;image resolution;inverse transforms;remote sensing","Hausdorff fractal dimension estimation method;shearlet domain;spectral information preservation;spatial resolution enhancement;remote sensing image fusion;HFD estimation method;remote sensing satellite image fusion method;high-spatial resolution panchromatic image;high-spatial resolution PAN image;multispectral image;MS image;modified low-pass band automatic selection;high-pass subband coefficients;ST decomposition","","","","20","IEEE","28 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this, firstly, a preprocessing strategy is used to remove illumination artifacts and results in less false detection than traditional threshold-based algorithms. Then, we use the corrected input data to define a new fitness function based on the difference image. The purpose of using Self-Adaptive Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization-Genetic Algorithm (SAPSOGA) is to combine two meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to search and find the feasible solution in the NP-hard change detection problem rapidly and efficiently. The hybrid algorithm is employed by letting the GA and PSO run simultaneously and similarities of GA and PSO have been considered to implement the algorithm, i.e. the population. In the SAPSOGA employed, in each iteration/generation the two population based algorithms share different amount of information or individual(s) between themselves. Thus, each algorithm informs each other about their best optimum results (fitness values and solution representations) which are obtained in their own population. The fitness function is minimized by using binary based SAPSOGA approach to produce binary change detection masks in each iteration to obtain the optimal change detection mask between two multi temporal multi spectral landsat images. The proposed approach effectively optimizes the change detection problem and finds the final change detection mask.","","978-1-4673-8460-5","10.1109/SAI.2016.7556007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7556007","Remote sensing;Image processing;Optimization;Self-adaptive hybrid algorithm;Genetic algorithm;Binary particle swarm optimization","Satellites;Change detection algorithms;Sociology;Statistics;Lighting;Genetic algorithms;Cost function","computational complexity;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;image processing;particle swarm optimisation;remote sensing","self-adaptive hybrid particle swarm optimization-genetic algorithm;SAPSOGA;unsupervised satellite change detection;contrast condition;satellite image;illumination change;illumination artifact removal;metaheuristic optimization algorithm;NP-hard change detection problem","","7","","21","IEEE","1 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problem becomes even more complicated under the few-shot setting yet it has barely been studied to date. In this paper, we propose a colorization framework for the RS scene for synthesizing optical images from their panchromatic (PAN) counterparts using color injection and attention fusion mechanism. Our proposed model ensures that the synthesized optical images are coherent with the structural variability of panchromatic images while constraining the realistic appearance in the optical domain from a few training image pairs. To accomplish the same, we introduce a novel Dual Attention fusion of Receptive Kernels (DARK) which considers the spatial nuances along with color injection conditioned on prior label allocation. DARK is a multi spectral-spatial feature generator that selectively accentuates important cross-spatial features based on attention fusion. We also employ a prior distribution constraint on color embedding generation for introducing vibrant yet diverse variance in a color generation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the publicly available EuroSAT and PatternNet datasets while demonstrating significant speedups. We showcase our results quantitatively by comparing the PSNR, mean squared error(MSE), and cosine similarity of generated images and qualitatively via visual perception.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2022.3141465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9674906","Image colorization;Panchromatic;Optical;Few-shot;Data Fusion;Attention;Remote Sensing","Image color analysis;Optical imaging;Training;Optimized production technology;Optical sensors;Kernel;Testing","","","","1","","","IEEE","7 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Many approaches of removing haze focus on processing multi-spectral or RGB images, whereas few of them utilize multi-sensor data. The multi-sensor data fusion is significant to provide auxiliary information since RGB images are sensitive to atmospheric conditions. In this paper, a dataset called SateHaze1k is established and composed of 1200 pairs clear Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), hazy RGB, and corresponding ground truth images, which are divided into three degrees of the haze, i.e. thin, moderate, and thick fog. Moreover, we propose a novel fusion dehazing method to directly restore the haze-free RS images by using an end-to-end conditional generative adversarial network(cGAN). The proposed network combines the information of both RGB and SAR images to eliminate the image blurring. Besides, the dilated residual blocks of the generator can also sufficiently improve the dehazing effects.
