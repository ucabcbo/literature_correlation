In this study, the water salinity of Lake Urmia was mapped using sentinel-2 Multispectral Images (MSI). A Support Vector Regression (SVR) was developed to predict the water salinity using sentinel-2 spectral bands and indices. Three main scenarios were considered when input features were used in the SVR model. In scenario 1, the SVR was fed by all the features generated from Sentinel-2 data, and in the other two scenarios, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Sequential Feature Selection (SFS) were applied to select the optimum input features to be used in the SVR model. The results showed that the salinity of Lake Urmia was estimated with a relatively reliable accuracy using GA along with the SVR model, where the R2 of 65.7% and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 11.5 PSU were obtained when the results were compared with in-situ data. Overall, this study showed that Sentinel-2 provides valuable high spatial-temporal datasets for continuous monitoring of water salinity over Lake Urmia.","","978-1-6654-7078-0","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics55649.2022.9859146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9859146","Water salinity;Lake Urmia;Sentinel-2 MSI;Support Vector Regression;Genetic algorithm","Water;Support vector machines;Satellites;Salinity (geophysical);Lakes;Data models;Reliability","genetic algorithms;geophysical image processing;hydrological techniques;lakes;mean square error methods;regression analysis;remote sensing;support vector machines","Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery;critical water properties;sentinel-2 Multispectral Images;sentinel-2 spectral bands;SVR model;Sentinel-2 data;Sequential Feature Selection;optimum input features;Lake Urmia water salinity mapping","","","","30","IEEE","23 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Training deep convolutional architecture with such a dataset is still a challenging task in land cover classification due to the absence of ground truth. Also, the selection of appropriate deep architecture for handling the Sentinel-2 dataset is another challenging task. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to extract the information from various combinations of bands in Sentinel-2 imagery. We use a loss function, proposed in an earlier work, to train our model in an unsupervised manner. Recent advances in deep learning allow for transferring knowledge from one data set to another. Thus, in our study, we aim at analyzing the “transfer learning” capabilities of our proposed network to land cover classification in Sentinel-2 images. Pre-trained weights of a deep neural architecture, which is trained with very high-resolution optical satellite imagery from Aviris is transferred to a network of almost similar architecture for processing Sentinel-2 data. We used Salinas, a publicly available hyper-spectral dataset, to train this architecture in a supervised fashion and, finally, use transfer learning and fine-tuning on the architecture handling Sentinel-2 data for clustering. Experiments show that bands of 60m resolution have a positive combining effect with bands of 20m resolution for segregating waterbody, urban settlement, and tree canopies distinctly.","2153-7003","978-1-7281-6374-1","10.1109/IGARSS39084.2020.9323985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9323985","Convolutional neural network;Land-cover classification;Clustering;Aviris Hyperspectral images;Sentinel-2 Multispectral Images","Feature extraction;Vegetation;Hyperspectral imaging;Image segmentation;Convolutional neural networks;Convolution;Task analysis","geophysical image processing;geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;image classification;image resolution;image segmentation;image sensors;land cover;land use;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;remote sensing;terrain mapping;unsupervised learning","unsupervised learning;land cover analysis;Sentinel-2 multispectral images;multispectral multiresolution dataset;deep convolutional architecture;land cover classification;Sentinel-2 dataset;convolutional neural network architecture;Sentinel-2 imagery;unsupervised manner;deep learning;transfer learning capabilities;pre-trained weights;deep neural architecture;high-resolution optical satellite imagery;Sentinel-2 data;hyper-spectral dataset","","1","","6","IEEE","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Python with its opensource libraries are utilized for downloading and processing the satellite data. Mandal (sub-district) level Mean NDVI, area under sparse and dense vegetation are estimated at the peak vegetative growth stage in Rabi season (February) from 2017 to 2020. In the assessment of satellite data, it was observed that the Godavari delta region has shown a decrease in the sparse vegetative area (11094 ha.) and an increase in dense vegetation area (3272 ha.) in 2018 as compared with 2019 assessment. However, in the Krishna delta region, it was observed that the sparse vegetation area was decreased (90600 ha) and an increased dense area (161915 ha.) in 2020 as compared with 2017.

In this study, we apply an empirical model to estimate coffee leaf ChI with Sentinel 2 MSI data. Results showed that coffee biophysical parameters (height and canopy cover) are significantly influenced by stand age while plant water concentration and total ChI are age invariant. Results further showed that the best modelling results (R2=0.69, RMSE=64.4) were achieved when all the bands at 10m spatial resolution with all data were used.

Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) is comprised of visible spectral bands, near infrared (NIR), and short wave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands. These spectral bands, band 8A (865 nm), band 11 (at 1.61 μm), and band 12 (at 2.19 μm), are employed to roughly approximate the temperature within the forest fire range (400 - 1500°C) using Planck's blackbody radiation law. The Normalised Difference Indices (NDI) of band 11 with 8A and band 12 with 11 are formulated, namely NDI1 and NDI2, respectively. The criteria of NDI1, NDI2, and band 12 ranges are estimated empirically to identify forest fire area into four thermal anomaly levels, i.e., high-temperature crown fire, typical crown fire, surface fire or smoldering area and remains of the fire. For the high-temperature crown fire area, band 12 value is very high, all indices are positive, and the NDI2 is lower than NDI1, following Planck's curve for temperature higher than 1200 K. For the typical crown fire area, the band 12 value is high, and the NDI2 can be higher than NDI1. For the smolder area, the band 12 value is in the middle range, and the NDI2 must be larger than 0.2. Finally, for remains area, the band 12 value is in the lower range, and NDI1 must be higher than -0.27. This work shows that the active fire area can be identified and mapped into four thermal anomaly levels. This approach can be employed for rapid fire management as soon as the image data is obtained.","","978-1-7281-6486-1","10.1109/ECTI-CON49241.2020.9158262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9158262","active fire mapping;Sentinel-2;fire management;forest fire;Planck’s law;remote sensing","Fires;Forestry;Temperature distribution;Satellites;Instruments;Earth;Telecommunications","atmospheric temperature;fires;geophysical techniques;terrain mapping","active fire mapping;Sentinel-2 data;map active fire area;Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument;visible spectral bands;NDI1;NDI2;band 12 ranges;forest fire area;high-temperature crown fire area;band 12 value;smoldering area;surface fire;normalised difference indices;Planck blackbody radiation law;short wave infrared spectral band;near infrared spectral band;thermal anomaly level algorithm;size 865.0 nm;size 1.61 mum;size 2.19 mum;temperature 1200.0 K;temperature 400.0 degC to 1500.0 degC","","1","","6","IEEE","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To assist the non-profit group to map the locations of Maasailand boma, we have investigated different types of remote sensing data and deep neural networks that can be applied for broad area search through satellite imagery. Our area of interest encompasses over 3900 square kilometers of Maasailand, where we have manually identified 635 boma homesteads for ground-truth. In this work, we evaluated the application of Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery on automatic boma mapping using the ProxylessNAS model. Specifically, we evaluated Sentinel-2 data at different scales for level-1C and level-2A products. Additionally, we extended the ProxylessNAS model to accommodate 4-band full multi-spectral imagery from the sensor. We investigated the 4-band variations that add the near infrared channel to the traditional RGB using the extended ProxylessNAS model. The highest preliminary cross-validation scores using Sentinel-2-1C data and Sentinel-2-2A data are 73.42% and 73.19% respectively.

Moreover, the lack of a real high-resolution ground-truth for super-resolution techniques may affect the radiometric quality of the final result. In this scenario, this work investigates the viability of using the Multi-Spectral Instrument of Sentinel-2 for super-resolving data products acquired by the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument of Sentinel-3.

As part of the current work, the artificial neural networks (ANN) classifier is combined with the post-classification comparison (PCC), thereby predicting seasonal variability from satellite imagery.

Accurate maps of grazing lawn distribution is essential to enhance understanding of important ecosystem processes such as mega-herbivore population dynamics, nutrient cycling and plant community composition. The inherent heterogeneity of savannah landscapes however creates significant challenges for accurate discrimination of vegetation components and thus grazing lawn detection. Recent studies favour very high spatial resolution (VHR) multi-spectral imagery for dealing with this challenge. However, such data are costly for use in operational management. Planet Labs, through Norway's International Climate and Forests Initiative (NICFI), now grant free access to high-resolution, analysis-ready mosaics over the tropics, with great potential for fine-scale vegetation mapping. However, the spectral characteristics of these data are limited and fail to resolve the spectral similarity of different savannah vegetation components. We address these issues using Gram-Schmidt transformation to fuse Planet Basemaps and Sentinel-2A images for grazing lawn detection within the Lower Sabie region of Kruger National Park, South Africa. The original and fused images were classified using a random forest approach. Overall, the fused image achieved the best grazing lawn detection accuracy (0.85) and general map accuracy (0.72) results compared to Sentinel-2 (0.67 and 0.62) and Planet basemap (0.64 and 0.62 respectively).

In this paper we investigate the use of a hyperspectral image to retrieve plume mass concentration and its flow rate from the plume optical properties. The method uses the combination of Sentinel-2 and hyperspectral data to classify, correct and segment surface reflectances below the plume. The retrieval of plume properties is based on a statistical framework called the “Optimal estimation method” (OEM) initialized by using first a sequential method. The method is applied to a particulate matter plume observed by the airborne HYSPEX sensor in February 2016 over a steel plant in the south-east of France. The HYSPEX image was taken in the solar reflective domain between 410 and 2500 nm. The retrieved parameters are the modal radius, the surface reflectance and the aerosol optical thickness (AOT). From optimal estimation method retrievals, the plume particulate matter column mass enhancement are computed for each pixel where the plume is detected. Plume particulate matter column mass enhancement vary between 200 and 1300 mg/pixel and the retrieved mean flow rate per wind speed meter per second is 1.6 g s−1 (m s−1)−1.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9554132","Hyperspectral;Multi-spectral;Aerosol plume","Satellites;Uncertainty;Wind speed;Estimation;Optical imaging;Steel;Optical sensors","aerosols;air pollution;atmospheric composition;atmospheric optics;atmospheric techniques;geophysical image processing;remote sensing;wind","hyperspectral data;particulate emissions;human health;air quality;hyperspectral image;plume mass concentration;plume optical properties;correct segment surface;plume properties;sequential method;particulate matter plume;retrieved parameters;surface reflectance;aerosol optical thickness;optimal estimation method retrievals;plume particulate matter column mass enhancement;retrieved mean flow rate;aerosol plume mass balance;plume property retrievals computed;Sentinel-2 data;size 410.0 nm to 2500.0 nm","","","","12","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, the study area (Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture) covered by 73.95% forests, of which approximately 18000 km2. Based on the GEE (Google Earth Engine) cloud computing platform, combined multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery with topography information, three machine learning classifiers, including Regression Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, were used to obtain nine tree species 10m meters of mapping products. An overall accuracy of 81.4% (a Cohen's kappa of 78.5%) was obtained for nine tree species classes. The addition of multi-temporal images improved the OA (over all accuracy) by 8.01%∼12.40%, and Kappa by 8.91%∼12.96%. After combining the terrain features, OA is improved by 9.39%∼14.72%, and Kappa by 10.95%∼18.19%.

However, in coastal areas, these phenomena are complex and their analyze requires multi-spectral images with both a high spatial and spectral resolution. Unfortunately, no satellite is able to provide both at the same time. As a consequence, multi-sharpening techniques-a.k.a. fusion or super- resolution of multi-spectral and/or hyper-spectral images-were proposed and consist of combining information from at least two multi-spectral images with different spatial and spectral resolutions. The fused image then combines their best characteristics. Various methods-based on different strategies and tools-have been proposed to solve this problem. This article presents a comparative review of fusion methods applied to Sentinel-2 MSI (13 spectral bands with a spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 60 m) and Sentinel-3 OLCI (21 spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 300 m) images. Indeed, both satellites are extensively used in marine observation and, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the fusion of their data was partially investigated (and not in the way we aim to do in this paper). To that end, we provide both a quantitative analysis of the performance of some state-of-the-art methods on simulated images, and a qualitative analysis on real images.","2158-6276","978-1-6654-3601-4","10.1109/WHISPERS52202.2021.9484009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9484009","Image fusion;Remote sensing;Sentinel-2 MSI;Sentinel-3 OLCI;Simulations;Real data","Satellites;Statistical analysis;Conferences;Sea measurements;Distance measurement;Sensors;Spatial resolution","geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;hyperspectral imaging;image fusion;image resolution;remote sensing","fusion methods;multi-sharpening techniques;multisharpening methods;multisharpening techniques;simulated images;Sentinel-3 OLCI;spectral bands;fused image;spectral resolutions;hyper-spectral images;spectral resolution;high spatial resolution;multispectral images;Sentinel-2 MSI","","2","","21","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, machine learning models have been applied for crop classification of Sentinel-2 satellite temporal remote sensing image data. Guntur district region of Andhra Pradesh, India has been used as the study area. The main reasons for selecting this region are the diversity of agricultural crops and the availability of ground truth. The performance of machine learning models Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and RNN with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) have been evaluated for crop classification. Classification accuracies are generally evaluated by using test data. In most cases the classification accuracy from test data is not commensurate to estimated crop areas from the classified image. Such methods limit the estimated crop areas acceptance for official purposes. The uniqueness of this work is the classification accuracy is evaluated by estimated crop areas. The results show that SVM has the best F1 score of 0.99 and estimated major crop areas have 95.9% agreement with the ground surveyed crop area.","","978-1-7281-5453-4","10.1109/IMCOM48794.2020.9001718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9001718","Artificial Intelligence;classification;crop-wise area statistics;remote sensing;and multi-spectral satellite image","Agriculture;Machine learning;Remote sensing;Satellites;Vegetation mapping;Support vector machines;Training data","convolutional neural nets;crops;geophysical image processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;statistical analysis;support vector machines;vegetation mapping","national economy;critical decisions;agricultural statistics;Sentinel-2 satellite temporal remote sensing image data;agricultural crops;machine learning models;recurrent neural network;long short-term memory;gated recurrent unit;ground surveyed crop area;temporal multispectral satellite image;artificial intelligence;efficient AI models;high-power computational resources;support vector machine;satellite remote sensing image data processing;Guntur district region;convolution neural network;Indian crop classification;SVM","","3","","33","IEEE","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Methods for detecting changes in multi-temporal satellite images are very useful tools when characterization and monitoring of urban growth patterns is concerned. Increasing worldwide availability of multispectral images with a high revisit frequency opened up more possibilities in the study of urban CD. Even though there exists several deep learning methods for CD, most of these available methods fail to predict the edges and preserve the shape of the changed area from multispectral images. This article introduces a deep learning model called urban CD network (UCDNet) for urban CD from bi-temporal multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. The model is based on an encoder–decoder architecture which uses modified residual connections and the new spatial pyramid pooling (NSPP) block, giving better predictions while preserving the shape of changed areas. The modified residual connections help locate the changes correctly, and the NSPP block can extract multiscale features and will give awareness about global context. UCDNet uses a proposed loss function which is a combination of weighted class categorical cross-entropy (WCCE) and modified Kappa loss. The Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) dataset is used to train, evaluate, and compare the proposed model with the benchmark models. UCDNet gives better results from the reference models used here for comparison. It gives an accuracy of 99.3%, an  $F1$  score ( $F1$ ) of 89.21%, a Kappa coefficient (Ka) of 88.85%, and a Jaccard index (JI) of 80.53% on the OSCD dataset.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3161337","RESPOND Scheme of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Government of India (December 30, 2019)(grant numbers:ISRO/RES/4/683/19-20); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9740122","Change detection (CD);deep learning;multi-spectral satellite images;spatial pyramid pooling (SPP)","Feature extraction;Convolution;Satellites;Remote sensing;Deep learning;Streaming media;Shape","deep learning (artificial intelligence);entropy;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image segmentation;object detection;remote sensing;town and country planning","JI;Jaccard index;Kappa coefficient;OSCD dataset;F1 score;Onera satellite change detection dataset;modified Kappa loss;WCCE;weighted class categorical cross-entropy;NSPP block;new spatial pyramid pooling block;encoder-decoder architecture;earth observation;urban change detection;modified residual connections;bi-temporal multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite images;UCDNet;urban CD network;deep learning model;multitemporal satellite images","","1","","55","IEEE","23 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Australian state of Victoria, with its wide range of forest vegetation was chosen as the study area to demonstrate the scalability and transferability of the approach. In this study aboveground forest biomass (AGB) was defined as the tons of carbon per hectare for the aboveground components (stem, branches, leaves) of all live large trees greater than 10 cm in diameter at breast height (DBHOB). Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data were fused within a machine learning framework using a boosted regression tree model and high-quality ground survey data. Multicriteria evaluations showed the use of the two independent and fundamentally different Sentinel satellite systems were able to provide robust estimates (R2 of 0.62, RMSE of 32.2 t.C.ha-1) of aboveground forest biomass, with each sensor compensating for the weakness (cloud perturbations and spectral saturation for Sentinel 2, and sensitivity to ground moisture for Sentinel 1) of each other.

Water can easily be extracted from satellite data under known/controlled conditions using simple thresholding techniques. However, these pixel thresholding techniques fail when applied over large regions because they cannot adapt the thresholds based on local variability. Although region-growing methods are available to overcome this issue, there is a limitation in using a global threshold value determined for a satellite scene. Such thresholds fail to adapt to the variations within the scene. Hence, this study proposed a new region-growing-based approach for improved classification of water features using Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data. The significant difference between this approach and other region-growing methods is that this technique uses dynamic thresholding for localized adaption. The local image statistics of the Normalized Different Water Index (NDWI) layer are used for adding new pixels to the region, and the threshold is adjusted for every new pixel added. This technique also minimizes manual intervention in water classification, thus enabling total process automation in near-real-time. The thresholds are dynamically determined not only for each scene but also for each new pixel being classified for the accurate delineation of the water pixels. A rigorous quality evaluation was done on the resultant water layer. This technique achieved an overall accuracy of 84.04% in challenging conditions.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2023.3246540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10049083","Adaptive thresholding;region growing;normalized difference water index (NDWI);water monitoring;water spread area","Water resources;Water;Feature extraction;Indexes;Seeds (agriculture);Reflectivity;Remote sensing","","","","","","","IEEE","20 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This study utilized the Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) images from dualpolarized Sentinel-1 and Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) from Sentinel-2 to study the impact of oil spills on Mangrove Forest in Pantai Cermin, Negeri Sembilan. The Random Forest classification was used to detect the oil spill areas, while vegetation indices were used to assess the impact of oil pollution on mangrove forests in the early stages. Analysis from Sentinel1 imagery shows that the oil spill could be accurately detected using the Random Forest classifer with accuracy of 76%.

Monitoring algal blooms from space allows for a continuous and automatic control without the necessity of water sampling and human intervention. However, it is a very challenging task, which becomes particularly difficult when dealing with cyanobacteria blooms. Water limnology, satellite imagery and neural networks can be used as an ensemble of remote sensing and machine learning technologies in order to estimate the concentration of algal blooms from space. This paper describes empirical algorithms to this end, which incorporate information from the multi-spectral instrument of Sentinel-2 satellite. This approach is applied to the Cefni Reservoir (Anglesey, U.K.), by using spatial and temporal scales.

This work aims at improving methodology for studying these features, by estimating chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations in the transitional Barents Sea by remotely sensing its optical properties, in order to better understand the large-scale algal bloom dynamics in the region. The in-situ measurements of chl-a are collected from the year 2016 to 2018 over a wide area of the Barents Sea to cover the spatial and temporal variations in chl-a concentration. Optical images of the Barents Sea are captured by the Multi-Spectral Imager Instrument on Sentinel-2. Using these remotely sensed optical images and the in-situ measurements, we propose a match-up dataset creation method based on the distribution of the remotely sensed reflectance spectra. Different Machine Learning (ML) techniques are assessed to estimate concentration of chl-a using the match-up dataset. Most of these techniques have not been investigated before in the subarctic region such as the Barents Sea.

The aerosol and water vapor parameters used in the 6SV model were obtained from the AERONET data. The evaluation results showed that for the visible bands, the Sen2Cor BOA reflectance was lower than the 6SV BOA reflectance, with a maximum relative bias of -36.5%, due to an overestimation of the aerosol optical depth retrieved by Sen2Cor. The bias of the BOA reflectance could also affect the vegetation index (VI) calculation. Four VIs were calculated and compared using the different BOA reflectance. The maximum relative bias was 18.2%.

Remote sensing imagery captured via satellites, drones, and aircraft has successfully influenced a wide range of fields such as monitoring vegetation health, tracking droughts, and weather forecasting, among others. Researchers studying the Earth's surface are often hindered while gathering reliable observations due to contaminated reflectance values that are sensitive to thin, thick, and cirrus clouds, as well as their shadows. In this study, we propose a deep learning network architecture, CloudNet, to alleviate cloud-occluded remote sensing imagery captured by Landsat-8 satellite for both visible and non-visible spectral bands. We propose a deep neural network model trained on a distributed storage cluster that leverages historical trends within Landsat-8 imagery while complementing this analysis with high-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery. Our empirical benchmarks profile the efficiency of the CloudNet model with a range of cloud-occluded pixels in the input image. We further compare our CloudNet's performance with state-of-the-art deep learning approaches such as SpAGAN and Resnet. We propose a novel method, dynamic hierarchical transfer learning, to reduce computational resource requirements while training the model to achieve the desired accuracy.

However, due to the imaging mechanism of SAR and the speckle noise, untrained people are difficult to recognize the land cover types visually from SAR images. Inspired by the excellent image-to-image translation performance of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a supervised Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network (S-CycleGAN) was proposed to generate large optical images from the SAR images. When the optical RS data are unavailable or partly unavailable, the generated optical images can be alternative data that aid in land cover visual recognition for untrained people. The main steps of SAR-to-optical image translation were as follows. First, the large SAR image was split to small patches. Then S-CycleGAN was used to translate the SAR patches to optical image patches. Finally, the optical image patches were stitched to generate the large optical image. A paired SAR-optical image dataset which covered 32 Chinese cities was published to evaluate the proposed method. The dataset was generated from Sentinel-1 (SEN-1) SAR images and Sentinel-2 (SEN-2) multi-spectral images. S-CycleGAN was applied to two experiments, which were SAR-to-optical image translation and cloud removal, and the results showed that S-CycleGAN could keep both the land cover and structure information well, and its performance was superior to some famous image-to-image translation models.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2939649","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2016YFB0502600); Thirteen-Five Civil Aerospace Planning Project — Integration of Communication, Navigation and Remote Sensing Comprehensive Application Technology; Chinese Technology Research and Development of the Major Project of High-Resolution Earth Observation System(grant numbers:03-Y20A10-9001-15/16); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8825802","SAR-to-optical image translation;visualization;GAN;Sentinel;cloud removal","Radar polarimetry;Optical imaging;Clouds;Optical sensors;Adaptive optics;Optical polarization;Gallium nitride","geophysical image processing;optical images;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;terrain mapping","SAR-to-optical image translation;supervised Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks;optical remote sensing data;optical RS data;imaging mechanism;generated optical images;SAR patches;optical image patches;paired SAR-optical image dataset;Sentinel-1 SAR images;multispectral images;image-to-image translation models;S-CycleGAN;Chinese cities;land cover;Generative Adversarial Networks;weather conditions;cloud contamination;bad weather","","59","","58","CCBY","5 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, it is necessary to develop an algorithm to distinguish U. prolifera and Sargassum from satellite images. In this study, the spectral difference between U. prolifera and Sargassum and the capability of several multispectral satellite missions to distinguish them is first analyzed. The results show that the reflectance peak in visible wavelength is always in ~550 nm for U. prolifera whether it is floating in clear open water or turbid nearshore water. However, the reflectance of Sargassum floating in clear and turbid water shows totally different characteristics, because most of Sargassum body is submerged in the water and the observed Sargassum reflectance is seriously affected by water reflectance. Compared with Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), HuanJing-1, Charge-Coupled Devices (HJ-1 CCD), Aqua Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Sentinel 2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI), GaoFen-1, Wide Field of View (GF-1 WFV) can preferably capture the spectral difference between U. prolifera and Sargassum. Based on the spectral difference analysis, we propose a random forest-based algorithm to distinguish U. prolifera and Sargassum from GF-1 WFV images with an overall accuracy of 97.6% except when U. prolifera and Sargassum mix together. The algorithm is more robust than the existing ones as it allowed more Sargassum samples from different ocean regions to be used in the training; in addition, it avoids negative effects caused by the selection of a threshold. The proposed algorithm is proved effective in distinguishing U. prolifera and Sargassum in the Yellow and East China Seas in May and June 2017 and in detecting Sargassum in the Atlantic Ocean. Thus, this method can be used in researches including floating macroalgae traceability and competition and succession between different macroalgae species in different regions of the ocean with similar environments.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3071154","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFC1405300); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61890964,41506203,U1906217); China–Korea Joint Ocean Research Project(grant numbers:PI-2019-1-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9406171","Machine learning algorithms;multispectral imaging;remote monitoring;tide","Satellites;Atmospheric modeling;Sea measurements;Hyperspectral imaging;Sea surface;Object oriented modeling;Algae","geophysical image processing;oceanographic techniques;vegetation","multispectral satellite images;U. prolifera;spectral difference;Sargassum body;observed Sargassum reflectance;random forest-based algorithm;GF-1 WFV images;Sargassum mix;Sargassum samples;macroalgae species;distinguish Ulva prolifera;AD 2017;multispectral satellite missions;Yellow Sea;east China Sea;wavelength 550.0 nm","","2","","65","IEEE","16 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
