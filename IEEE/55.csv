Firstly, the multi-temporal remote sensing change detection problem is converted as a problem of semi-supervised learning on graph where a majority of unlabeled nodes and a few labeled nodes are contained. Then, GANs are adopted to generate samples in a competitive manner and help improve the classification accuracy. Finally, a binary change map is produced by classifying the unlabeled nodes to a certain class with the help of both the labeled nodes and the unlabeled nodes on graph. Experimental results carried on several very high resolution remote sensing image data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8898913","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8898913","Change Detection;Semi-supervised Learning;Graph Model;Generative Adversarial Network","Gallium nitride;Generative adversarial networks;Task analysis;Remote sensing;Semisupervised learning;Training;Generators","geophysical image processing;geophysical signal processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing","unlabeled nodes;high resolution remote;semisupervised change detection;Generative Adversarial Networks;semisupervised remote sensing change detection method;graph model;GANs;multitemporal remote sensing change detection problem;semisupervised learning;labeled nodes;binary change map","","10","","10","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose the Cloud Transformer Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN), taking three temporal cloudy images as input and generating a corresponding cloud-free image. Unlike previous work using generative networks, we design the feature extractor to maintain the weight of the cloudless region while reducing the weight of the cloudy region, and we pass the extracted features to a conformer module to find the most critical representations. Mean-while, to address the lack of datasets, we collected a new dataset named Sen2_MTC from the Sentinel-2 satellite and manually labeled each cloudy and cloud-free image. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on FS-2, the STGAN dataset, and Sen2_MTC. Our proposed CTGAN demonstrates higher qualitative and quantitative performance than the previous work and achieves state-of-the-art performance on these three datasets.

In order to reduce costs and ensure the performance, it is advisable to employ a semisupervised strategy to achieve this goal. As a discriminative joint classification task, semisupervised change detection aims to extract useful and discriminative features from a large amount of unlabeled data in addition to limited labeled samples. The discriminator of a well-trained generative adversarial network (GAN) is just right for this. Therefore, in this letter, we proposed a semisupervised GAN-based multiple change detection framework for multi-spectral images. First, the GAN is trained by all data without any prior information. Then, we combine two identical trained discriminators to construct a dual-pipeline joint classifier. Finally, the classifier is fine-tuned by a very small amount of labeled data to detect multiple changes. The superior performance of the proposed model over both real multi-spectral data sets demonstrates its robustness and effectiveness.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2019.2941318","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772393); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2018ZDXM-GY-045); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854295","Generative adversarial network (GAN);multi-spectral images;multiple change detection;semisupervised","Feature extraction;Gallium nitride;Task analysis;Training;Remote sensing;Data mining;Generative adversarial networks","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;neural nets;object detection;remote sensing","multispectral images;multitemporal remote sensing images;discriminative joint classification task;semisupervised change detection;discriminative features;identical trained discriminators;multispectral data sets;semisupervised GAN-based multiple change detection","","14","","19","IEEE","1 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most end-to-end networks are proposed for supervised change detection, and unsupervised change detection models depend on traditional pre-detection methods. Therefore, we proposed a fully convolutional change detection framework with generative adversarial network, to unify unsupervised, weakly supervised, regional supervised, and fully supervised change detection tasks into one end-to-end framework. A basic Unet segmentor is used to obtain change detection map, an image-to-image generator is implemented to model the spectral and spatial variation between multi-temporal images, and a discriminator for changed and unchanged is proposed for modeling the semantic changes in weakly and regional supervised change detection task. The iterative optimization of segmentor and generator can build an end-to-end network for unsupervised change detection, the adversarial process between segmentor and discriminator can provide the solutions for weakly and regional supervised change detection, the segmentor itself can be trained for fully supervised task. The experiments indicate the effectiveness of the propsed framework in unsupervised, weakly supervised and regional supervised change detection. This paper provides new theorical definitions for unsupervised, weakly supervised and regional supervised change detection tasks with the proposed framework, and shows great potentials in exploring end-to-end network for remote sensing change detection.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2023.3237896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10019593","Remote Sensing;Change Detection;Fully Covolutional Network;Generative Adversarial Network;Weakly Supervised Segmentation","Task analysis;Image segmentation;Generators;Remote sensing;Generative adversarial networks;Predictive models;Training","","","","","","","IEEE","18 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
