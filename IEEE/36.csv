This will also enhance the system’s efficiency and provide more details on modeling the physical phenomena occurring on the Earth’s surface. In this article, we introduce a flexible and efficient method based on graph Laplacians for information selection at different levels of data fusion. The proposed approach combines data structure and information content to address the limitations of existing graph-Laplacian-based methods in dealing with heterogeneous datasets. Moreover, it adapts the selection to each homogenous area of the considered images according to their underlying properties. Experimental tests carried out on several multivariate remote sensing datasets show the consistency of the proposed approach.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3124308","Centre for Integrated Remote Sensing and Forecasting for Arctic Operations; Norges Forskningsråd(grant numbers:237906); Automatic Multi-sensor Remote Sensing for Sea Ice Characterization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9599440","Gaussian kernel (GK);graph Laplacians;multimodal remote sensing;mutual information (MI);unsupervised information selection","Laplace equations;Dimensionality reduction;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Feature extraction;Earth;Data analysis","data analysis;data structures;feature selection;geophysical image processing;graph theory;image fusion;remote sensing","Earth's surface;information selection;data fusion;data structure;information content;multivariate remote sensing datasets;multimodal feature selection;remote sensing data analysis;double graph Laplacian diagonalization","","1","","82","CCBYNCND","2 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
