It is well known that radar measurements are highly dependent on the roughness characteristics of the observed scene and can have a profound effect on altimetry-based thickness estimates. This simulation-based study highlights the importance of sea-ice roughness parameterization in the context of radar altimetry. This work provides a new sea-ice roughness parameterization in the form of an elevation spectrum developed from field campaign data. The formulation of this elevation spectrum is partly based on the generalized power law. Simulations have been developed to predict electromagnetic scattering from surfaces described by the new spectrum, with a focus on the X-band (10 GHz) scattering with nadir incidence. In this work, both the analytical small slope approximation and numerically exact Method of Moments are applied to various sea-ice surface spectra, representing a wide range of surface roughness conditions. The results show that the normalized radar cross section of the sea-ice interface varies significantly depending on the surface elevation spectrum and the statistics of the rough interface. Comparisons with numerically exact methods show that analytical approximations to rough surface scattering work reasonably well for the cases considered here, except at large scattering angles.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3077394","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N0001421WX00025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9434392","Radar altimetry;rough surface scattering;sea-ice thickness","Sea surface;Surface roughness;Sea ice;Rough surfaces;Correlation;Sea measurements;Radar","electromagnetic wave scattering;ice;oceanographic techniques;radar altimetry;radar cross-sections;remote sensing by radar;rough surfaces;sea ice;surface roughness","rough surface scattering model comparisons;sea ice;sea-ice thickness;microwave radar altimetry;radar measurements;roughness characteristics;altimetry-based thickness estimates;simulation-based study highlights;sea-ice roughness parameterization;sea-ice surface spectra;surface roughness conditions;normalized radar cross section;sea-ice interface varies;surface elevation spectrum;rough interface;rough surface scattering work;frequency 10.0 GHz","","","","19","USGov","18 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During that expedition, named MOSAiC, a comprehensive data set of airborne laser scanner (ALS) and spaceborne X-band SAR images in the area of the research vessel was acquired. With successful fusion of these two measurements, we can extrapolate sea ice features from the ALS data to the entire SAR scene using a convolutional neural network (CNN). From two preliminary scenes of ALS data we are able to show this for classes of sea ice roughness. This will be the basis for more comprehensive research, once the complete data set is available.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553340","DFG Projekt; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9553340","Sea Ice;SAR;ALS;CNN","Sea surface;Sea measurements;Measurement by laser beam;Surface roughness;Radar polarimetry;Data models;Rough surfaces","airborne radar;convolutional neural nets;geophysical image processing;oceanographic regions;radar imaging;remote sensing by laser beam;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","CNN;spaceborne X-band SAR images;AD 2020;autumn season;Polarstern research vessel;Arctic pack ice;ice floe;MOSAiC expedition;airborne laser scanner data;sea ice roughness;convolutional neural network;ALS data","","1","","7","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Information about sea ice is used in activities associated with transportation, fishing, disaster mitigation, oil deposit and other commercial development. Satellite SAR is a powerful tool for the detailed ice mapping, detection of the ice type, concentration, roughness, floe size and velocity through its high resolution and independence on cloudiness. Joint analysis of C- and L-band SAR data with the visible and/or infrared images with resolution of several tens-hundred meters improves interpretation of sea ice signatures and allows estimation of ice parameters.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-3332-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7730266","Sea ice;Envisat ASAR;Sentinel-1A SAR;ALOS-1 PALSAR;Okhotsk Sea;Japan Sea;ice eddy","Satellites;Sea ice;Satellite broadcasting;Synthetic aperture radar;Sea surface;L-band;Climate change","clouds;estimation theory;oceanographic regions;sea ice;seawater;synthetic aperture radar","Okhotsk sea ice formation;Japan sea;climate change;ocean water properties;sea ice concentration;sea ice development;sea ice melting;sea ice thickness;sea ice movement;sea ice concentration;air interaction;oil deposit transportation;oil deposit fishing;oil deposit disaster mitigation;commercial development;ice mapping;ice type;floe size;sea ice roughness;sea ice velocity;floe velocity;high resolution;cloudiness;L-band SAR data;C- L-band SAR data;visible image;infrared image;sea ice parameter estimation;sea ice signature;satellite SAR","","1","","7","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
