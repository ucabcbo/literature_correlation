One line of evidence involves comparison with Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) observations, including the areas of low aerosol loading close to Antarctica. In this paper, a principal reason for the AOD overestimation is identified, which is stray light measured by the MISR cameras in dark regions of high-contrast scenes. A small fraction of the light from surrounding bright areas, such as clouds or sea ice, is redistributed to dark areas, artificially increasing their brightness. Internal reflections and light scattering from optical elements in MISR's pushbroom cameras contribute to this veiling light effect. A simple correction model is developed that relies on the average scene brightness and an empirically determined set of veiling light coefficients for each MISR camera and wavelength. Several independent methods are employed to determine these coefficients. Three sets of coefficients are further implemented and tested in prototype MISR 4.4-km AOD retrievals. The results show dramatic improvements in retrieved AODs compared against MAN observations and the currently operational V22 MISR retrievals. For the best performing set of coefficients, the bias is reduced by 51%, from 0.039 to 0.019, the RMSE is lowered by 19%, from 0.062 to 0.050, and 84% of retrievals fall within the uncertainty envelope compared with 66% of retrievals in V22. The best performing set will be implemented operationally in the next V23 MISR AOD product release.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2727342","Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8207771","Air pollution;remote sensing;spectroradiometers;stray light","Cameras;Aerosols;MODIS;Clouds;Satellites;Lenses","aerosols;atmospheric optics;clouds;remote sensing","MISR cameras;sea ice;light scattering;MISR's pushbroom cameras;veiling light coefficients;MAN observations;V23 MISR AOD product release;MISR AOD retrievals;aerosol optical depth;Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer data;pristine oceanic areas;Maritime Aerosol Network observations;low aerosol loading close;AOD overestimation;operational V22 MISR retrievals;clouds;Antarctica","","6","","54","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
